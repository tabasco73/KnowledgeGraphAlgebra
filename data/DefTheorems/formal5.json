Proof: If $\\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{b}$, there is no loss of generality in assuming $\\mathfrak{a}=\\mathfrak{b} \\neq 0$. Then $b \\in \\mathfrak{a}$ and there exists an element $c \\in R$ such that $b=c a$. Likewise, we have $a \\in \\mathfrak{b}$ and therefore an element $c^{\\prime} \\in R$ such that $a=c^{\\prime} b$. Then $b=c a=c c^{\\prime} b$, and thus $\\left(1-c c^{\\prime}\\right) b=0$. Since $R$ is an integral domain and $b$ is nonzero due to $\\mathfrak{b} \\neq 0$, we get $c c^{\\prime}=1$, and $c$ is a unit. The reverse implication is trivial."
