                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a subset is necessary for the definition of a simple field extension, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a simple field extension. The definition states that a field extension $K \\subset L$ is called simple if there exists an element $\\alpha \\in L$ such that $L=K(\\alpha)$. The notation $K \\subset L$ explicitly uses the concept of a subset, indicating that $K$ is a subset of $L$. This implies that all elements of $K$ are also elements of $L$. Without understanding what a subset is, one cannot fully grasp the meaning of $K \\subset L$, which is fundamental to the definition of a field extension, and consequently, to the definition of a simple field extension. Therefore, the concept of a subset is essential to properly define and understand a simple field extension.",
