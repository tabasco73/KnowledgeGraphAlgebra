                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Commutative Ring is necessary for the definition of a Field of Fractions, we need to analyze the requirements for constructing a Field of Fractions. The definition of a Field of Fractions specifically mentions that it is constructed from an integral domain $R$. An integral domain is a special type of commutative ring which is nonzero and has no zero divisors. Therefore, the concept of a commutative ring is inherently involved in the definition of an integral domain. Since a Field of Fractions is constructed from an integral domain, and an integral domain is a type of commutative ring, the concept of a commutative ring is indeed necessary for the definition of a Field of Fractions. Without the concept of a commutative ring, the structure of an integral domain, and consequently the structure needed to define a Field of Fractions, would not be properly established.",
