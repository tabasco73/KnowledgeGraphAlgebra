                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Polynomial Ring is necessary for the definition of a Splitting Field of a Family of Polynomials, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Splitting Field of a Family of Polynomials mentions that it involves a family of nonconstant polynomials \\(\\mathfrak{F}=(f_i)_{i \\in I}, f_i \\in K[X]\\) over a field \\(K\\). This indicates that the polynomials \\(f_i\\) are elements of the polynomial ring \\(K[X]\\).\\n\\n2. The polynomial ring \\(K[X]\\) is defined as the set of all sequences where coefficients are from the field \\(K\\), and the operations of addition and multiplication are defined to handle these sequences. This structure allows for the formal handling of polynomials as mathematical objects.\\n\\n3. Since the polynomials \\(f_i\\) are explicitly stated to be elements of \\(K[X]\\) in the definition of the Splitting Field, the concept of a Polynomial Ring is inherently required. Without the structure provided by the Polynomial Ring, the polynomials \\(f_i\\) would not have a well-defined form or operations, making the concept of their splitting field incoherent.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Polynomial Ring is necessary for the definition of a Splitting Field of a Family of Polynomials to make sense, as it provides the foundational structure for the polynomials involved in the definition.",
