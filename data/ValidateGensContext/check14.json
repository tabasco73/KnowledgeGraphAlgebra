                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field, we need to consider the fundamental properties of fields and their operations. A field, by definition, includes two binary operations: addition and multiplication. These operations are examples of laws of composition because they map pairs of elements from the field back to the field, satisfying the closure property.\\n\\nIn the context of an algebraic closure of a finite field, such as $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_p$, the field must inherently include these operations of addition and multiplication, both of which are laws of composition. Therefore, the concept of a law of composition is implicitly required because it underpins the very structure of field operations. Without laws of composition, the operations within a field, and consequently within its algebraic closure, would not be well-defined.\\n\\nThus, the concept of a law of composition is essential for the definition and understanding of an algebraic closure of a finite field, as it ensures that the field operations are properly defined and behave consistently within the extended field structure.",
