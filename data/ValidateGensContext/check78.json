                "Explanation": "The definition of a Law of Composition states that it is a map from the Cartesian product of a set $M$ with itself ($M \\times M$) to the set $M$. This definition inherently uses the concept of a map or function, as it describes the law of composition as a specific type of map that takes pairs of elements from $M$ and assigns them to an element in $M$. Without the concept of a map or function, the mechanism by which elements of $M \\times M$ are associated to elements of $M$ would not be defined or understood. Therefore, the concept of a map or function is essential for the definition of a law of composition to be meaningful and complete.",
