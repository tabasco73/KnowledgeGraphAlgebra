                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Field Extension is necessary for defining a Trivial Algebraic field extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Trivial Algebraic field extension states that it is an algebraic field extension $L / K$ where every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This definition inherently uses the notion of a field extension, as it specifies $L / K$, indicating that $L$ is an extension of $K$.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Field Extension is a pair of fields $K \\subset L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This establishes the relationship between $K$ and $L$ as one of extension, which is fundamental to understanding what it means for $L$ to be an extension of $K$.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Field Extension provides the foundational framework for understanding what it means for one field to be an extension of another. Without this concept, the definition of a Trivial Algebraic field extension would lack the necessary context to make sense, as it relies on the relationship established by the concept of a Field Extension.",
