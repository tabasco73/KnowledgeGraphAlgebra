(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Purely Inseparable Extension, we need to analyze the components involved in each definition.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Purely Inseparable Extension involves a field extension. A field is a particular kind of ring that is both commutative and has multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements. Therefore, the concept of a field inherently includes the properties of a ring.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Purely Inseparable Extension specifically mentions the minimal polynomial of elements in the extension. Polynomials are defined over rings, and in the context of field extensions, these rings are fields. Thus, understanding and working with polynomials in this context requires the underlying structure of a ring.\\n\\n3. Since a field is a specialized form of a ring, and since field extensions (and thus purely inseparable extensions) inherently involve fields, the concept of a ring is fundamental. Without the concept of a ring, the structure and properties of fields, and consequently the understanding of field extensions like purely inseparable extensions, would not be well-defined.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a ring is necessary for the definition of a purely inseparable extension because it underpins the more specialized concept of a field, which is crucial for discussing field extensions and their properties.",
