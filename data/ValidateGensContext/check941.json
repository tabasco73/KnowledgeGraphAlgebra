                "Explanation": "The definition of a Canonical Homomorphism explicitly states that it is a type of ring homomorphism. Specifically, it describes a ring homomorphism that reduces the coefficients of a polynomial modulo a prime element in a ring. This implies that the concept of a ring homomorphism is fundamental to understanding what a canonical homomorphism does and how it operates. Without the concept of a ring homomorphism, which outlines the basic properties and requirements (such as preserving addition and multiplication), the definition and functioning of a canonical homomorphism would not be clear or meaningful. Therefore, the concept of a ring homomorphism is necessary for the definition of a canonical homomorphism to make sense.",
