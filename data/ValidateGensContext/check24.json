                "Explanation": "The definition of the Center of a group $G$ involves the concept of elements $x$ in $G$ commuting with every element $s$ in $G$, i.e., $xs = sx$. This definition inherently uses the operation (law of composition) defined on the group $G$, as it refers to the product $xs$ and $sx$. Without a law of composition, the expressions $xs$ and $sx$ would have no meaning because there would be no operation to describe how elements of $G$ combine. Therefore, the concept of a law of composition is necessary to define the center of a group, as it provides the framework within which elements can interact and thus determines whether they commute with all other elements in the group.",
