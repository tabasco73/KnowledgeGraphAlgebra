Both conditions explicitly use the notation '$\\in$', which denotes membership of an element in a set. The first condition states that the identity element $e$ must be an element of $H$. The second condition states that for any elements $a$ and $b$ in $H$, the product $ab$ must also be an element of $H$.\\n\\nThe use of '$\\in$' directly implies the necessity of understanding what it means for something to be an 'element of a set'. Without this concept, the conditions for $H$ being a submonoid cannot be properly formulated or understood, as they fundamentally depend on the ability to identify and confirm the membership of certain objects (like $e$, $a$, and $b$) within the set $H$.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is essential for the definition of a 'Submonoid' to make sense, as it underpins the criteria used to determine whether a subset $H$ qualifies as a submonoid of $G$.",
