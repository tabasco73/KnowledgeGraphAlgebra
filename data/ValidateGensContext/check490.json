                "Explanation": "The definition of a splitting field of a family of polynomials explicitly references the concept of a field in several ways:\\n1. The definition states that the splitting field is a field \\(L\\) extending another field \\(K\\).\\n2. It mentions that the polynomials \\(f_i\\) are elements of \\(K[X]\\), where \\(K\\) is a field, implying that the coefficients of the polynomials are in a field.\\n3. The definition requires that \\(L\\) be a field where the polynomials split into linear factors, which involves operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) defined in the context of field theory.\\n4. The extension \\(L / K\\) is described, which is a concept in field theory describing fields built upon another field.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of a field is fundamental to understanding and defining a splitting field of a family of polynomials. Without the concept of a field, the operations and properties described in the definition of a splitting field would not have a meaningful or coherent framework.",
