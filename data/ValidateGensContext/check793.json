                "Explanation": "The definition of a normal field extension explicitly references the concept of a polynomial. It states that a normal field extension is an extension field that is the splitting field of a family of polynomials from the base field. Additionally, it mentions that the field extension is normal if it is a splitting field for a family of polynomials in \\(K[X]\\), where \\(K[X]\\) denotes the ring of polynomials with coefficients in the base field \\(K\\). Furthermore, it also states that every irreducible polynomial in \\(K[X]\\) that has a zero in \\(L\\) must decompose completely into linear factors over \\(L\\). Thus, the concept of a polynomial is integral to understanding what constitutes a normal field extension, as polynomials are used to define the conditions under which an extension field is considered normal.",
