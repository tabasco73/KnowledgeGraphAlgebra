If $G$ is a group, $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if in addition, (iii) $a \\in H \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\in H$. In particular, a subgroup of a group $G$ is a submonoid that is closed under the process of taking inverses. In defining a subgroup $H \\subset G$, condition (i) can be weakened by simply requiring $H \\neq \\emptyset$, since this implies $e \\in H$ using (ii) and (iii). Of course, similar reasoning is not possible for monoids. Every group $G$ admits $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ as trivial subgroups. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the set $m \\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integral multiples of $m$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}$. We will see in 1.3/4 that all subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of this type. More generally, every element $a$ of a group $G$ gives rise to a so-called cyclic subgroup of $G$. It consists of all powers $a^{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where we put $a^{n}=\\left(a^{-1}\\right)^{-n}$ for $n<0; see also Section 1.3."

The definition of a subgroup begins by considering a subset $H$ of a group $G$. The notion of a subset inherently involves understanding what it means for objects (elements) to belong to a set.\\n\\n2. The conditions for a subset $H$ to be a subgroup include: (i) $e \\n H$, (ii) $a, b \\n H \\n a b \\n H$, and (iii) $a \\n H \\n a^{-1} \\n H$. Each of these conditions explicitly uses the concept of elements belonging to the set $H$.\\n\\n3. The definition of a subgroup is fundamentally about certain elements of the group $G$ satisfying specific properties to form a smaller group $H$. Without the concept of an element of a set, it would be impossible to specify which objects of $G$ are included in $H$ and to discuss properties like closure under group operations and taking inverses.\\n\\n4. Therefore, understanding what it means for something to be an element of a set is crucial for the definition of a subgroup, as it underpins the entire structure and properties of subgroups.",
