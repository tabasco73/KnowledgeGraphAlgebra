                "Explanation": "The definition of a Frobenius homomorphism involves a specific type of function between elements of a field $K$ where each element $a$ is mapped to $a^p$. This function is described as a homomorphism because it preserves the field structure, specifically the addition and multiplication operations in the field. \\n\\nA group homomorphism is a more general concept where a function between two groups (or monoids) preserves the group operation. In the context of fields, which are indeed groups under addition and multiplication (ignoring zero for multiplication), the concept of a group homomorphism underlies the definition of any homomorphism that preserves these operations, including the Frobenius homomorphism. \\n\\nThus, understanding what a group homomorphism is helps in comprehending how the Frobenius homomorphism preserves the field operations, making the concept of a group homomorphism necessary for defining a Frobenius homomorphism.",
