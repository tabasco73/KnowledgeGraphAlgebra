                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a set is necessary for defining a Galois group of a field extension, we need to analyze the components involved in the definition of a Galois group. The Galois group of a field extension, denoted as $\\operatorname{Gal}(L / K)$, is defined as the group of all field automorphisms of $L$ that fix every element of $K$. \\n\\n1. A field automorphism is a bijective map from the field to itself that preserves the field operations (addition and multiplication). \\n2. The collection of all such automorphisms forms a group under the operation of composition of functions. \\n3. This group, $\\operatorname{Gal}(L / K)$, consists of elements (automorphisms) and the structure of the group (defined by the operation of composition and the group axioms).\\n\\nThe concept of a set is fundamental here because the group itself is a set of automorphisms. Each automorphism is a distinct object, and the collection of these automorphisms forms a set under the definition provided. Moreover, the field $L$ and the subfield $K$ are also sets of elements (in this case, elements of the field). Thus, the definition and understanding of fields, automorphisms, and groups inherently rely on the concept of sets as collections of distinct objects.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a set is essential for defining the Galois group of a field extension because without the concept of sets, the notions of fields, automorphisms, and groups cannot be properly formulated or understood.",
