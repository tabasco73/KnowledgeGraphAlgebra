                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of an Extension Field is necessary for defining the Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The Galois group of a polynomial equation is defined as the group of automorphisms of the splitting field of the polynomial that fix the base field. These automorphisms permute the roots of the polynomial.\\n\\n2. An extension field $[\\mathbb{F}_q / \\mathbb{F}_p]$ is defined as a field consisting of $q=p^n$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number and $n$ is a positive integer. This field is uniquely characterized up to isomorphism as a splitting field of the polynomial $X^q-X$ over $[\\mathbb{F}_p]$.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a splitting field is central to the definition of the Galois group. The splitting field itself is an example of an extension field, specifically one that arises as the field extension containing all roots of a given polynomial. Therefore, understanding and defining extension fields is crucial for the concept of splitting fields, which in turn is essential for defining the Galois group of a polynomial. Thus, the concept of an extension field is necessary for the definition of the Galois group of polynomial splitting fields.",
