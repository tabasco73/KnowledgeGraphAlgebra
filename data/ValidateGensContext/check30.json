                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Submodule, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Submodule states that it is a subset of an A-module M that is closed under the operations of M. This implies that there are operations defined on M which the subset N must also satisfy.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Law of Composition describes it as a map from $M \\times M$ to $M$, essentially defining an operation on the set M. This operation is typically a binary operation, such as addition or multiplication, depending on the structure of M.\\n\\n3. Since a submodule must be closed under the operations of M, and these operations are defined by a law of composition (as per the definition), it follows that the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary. Without a defined operation (law of composition) on M, it would not be possible to determine whether a subset N is closed under these operations, as there would be no operations specified.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Law of Composition is essential for the definition of a Submodule because it provides the framework for the operations that the submodule must be closed under.",
