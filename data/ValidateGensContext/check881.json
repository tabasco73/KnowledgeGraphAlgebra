                "Explanation": "The concept of a 'System of generators' as defined relates to an A-module M, where A is a ring, not necessarily a field. The definition specifies that a system of generators for an A-module M consists of a family of elements (x_i)_{i in I} such that M can be expressed as the sum of the products of elements of A and the x_i's. This definition inherently relies on the structure of a ring (A) and its module (M), but it does not specifically require that A be a field. A field, by definition, is a commutative division ring, which is a specific type of ring with additional properties (namely, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse). However, the definition of a system of generators does not necessitate these additional properties of a field; it only requires the basic ring structure to define the operations within the module. Therefore, the concept of a field is not necessary for the definition of a system of generators to make sense; a ring (which is a more general concept than a field) suffices.",
