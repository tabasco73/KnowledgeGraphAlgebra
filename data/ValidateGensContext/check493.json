This means that the concept of zero divisors is inherently part of the definition of a Dedekind domain. Understanding what zero divisors are is crucial to comprehending the nature of a Dedekind domain, as the absence of nontrivial zero divisors (i.e., zero divisors other than zero itself) is a defining characteristic. Therefore, the concept of zero divisors must be defined and understood for the definition of a Dedekind domain to be fully comprehensible and meaningful.",
