If $G$ is a group, $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if in addition, (iii) $a \\in H \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\in H$. In particular, a subgroup of a group $G$ is a submonoid that is closed under the process of taking inverses. In defining a subgroup $H \\subset G$, condition (i) can be weakened by simply requiring $H \\neq \\emptyset$, since this implies $e \\in H$ using (ii) and (iii). Of course, similar reasoning is not possible for monoids. Every group $G$ admits $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ as trivial subgroups. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the set $m \\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integral multiples of $m$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}$. We will see in 1.3/4 that all subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of this type. More generally, every element $a$ of a group $G$ gives rise to a so-called cyclic subgroup of $G$. It consists of all powers $a^{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where we put $a^{n}=\\left(a^{-1}\\right)^{-n}$ for $n<0; see also Section 1.3."

                "Explanation": "The concept of a subgroup is defined independently of the concept of a p-group. The definition of a subgroup focuses on the properties and conditions a subset must satisfy to be considered a subgroup of a group. These conditions include closure under the group operation and the existence of inverses for all elements of the subset. The definition of a p-group, on the other hand, pertains to the specific nature of the group itself, namely that its order (the number of elements in the group) is a power of a prime number. The definition of a subgroup does not require any knowledge of the order of the group or whether the group's order is a power of a prime. Therefore, understanding or defining a p-group is not necessary for the concept of a subgroup to make sense. The two concepts operate independently in group theory.",
