                "Explanation": "The concept of a Sum of Ideals involves the addition of elements from two ideals within a ring. An ideal is a specific subset of a ring that satisfies certain properties, and a ring is a set equipped with two binary operations: addition and multiplication, which satisfy certain axioms. The definition of a Sum of Ideals does not require the concept of a domain as defined in the context of functions. The domain in the context of functions refers to the set of all possible inputs for which a function is defined, which is unrelated to the concept of ideals in a ring. Therefore, understanding or defining a Sum of Ideals does not depend on the concept of a domain as it pertains to functions.",
