The Symmetric Group is essentially the group of all such permutations. Therefore, understanding what permutations are and how they operate within the context of a group (like the Symmetric Group) is crucial for defining the Dihedral Group, which is generated by specific permutations of the Symmetric Group. Thus, the concept of the Symmetric Group is necessary to fully understand and define the Dihedral Group.",
