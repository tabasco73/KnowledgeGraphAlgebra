                "Explanation": "The concept of a Least Common Multiple (LCM) involves finding an element within a ring R that satisfies certain divisibility conditions relative to other elements of the same ring. Specifically, the LCM must be a common multiple of given elements in R and must divide any other common multiple of these elements. This definition is self-contained within the context of a single ring R and does not require the consideration of a subring or a larger ring.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Ring Extension involves a relationship between two rings, where one ring S is a subring of another ring R. This concept is concerned with the properties and interactions between two different rings, rather than the properties of elements within a single ring.\\n\\nGiven these definitions, the concept of a Ring Extension is not necessary for the definition or understanding of a Least Common Multiple. The definition of LCM is complete with respect to a single ring and does not rely on the existence or properties of a subring or an extended ring.",
