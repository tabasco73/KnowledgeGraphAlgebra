                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Ring is necessary for defining the Galois group of a Field Extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of the Galois group involves field automorphisms of a field extension $L/K$. A field is a special kind of ring that has additional properties, specifically the existence of multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements.\\n\\n2. The definition of a ring provides the foundational algebraic structure that includes operations of addition and multiplication, which are essential for the definition of a field. Without the concept of a ring, the algebraic structure of a field cannot be fully understood or defined since a field is essentially a ring with additional properties (like the existence of multiplicative inverses).\\n\\n3. Since a field is a type of ring, and the Galois group deals with field automorphisms (which inherently use the ring structure of the field), the concept of a ring is necessary to understand and define the operations and properties involved in the field and hence in the Galois group of a field extension.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a ring is necessary for the definition of the Galois group of a field extension because it underpins the basic algebraic structure of fields, which are central to the definition of the Galois group.",
