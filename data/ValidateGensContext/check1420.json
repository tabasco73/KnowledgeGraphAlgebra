                "Explanation": "The definition of the Frobenius homomorphism involves a single field $K$ and defines a map from $K$ to itself. This map, $\\\\(\\sigma: K \\longrightarrow K, \\\\quad a \\longmapsto a^{p}\\\\)$, is defined entirely within the context of the field $K$ and does not require the concept of another field $L$ or a relationship between $K$ and $L$. The Frobenius homomorphism is an endomorphism (a homomorphism from a field to itself) and does not inherently involve any extension of $K$. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a field extension involves two fields, $K$ and $L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This concept is about the relationship between two different fields and is not necessary for defining or understanding the Frobenius homomorphism, which operates within a single field. Therefore, the concept of a field extension is not needed to define or understand the Frobenius homomorphism.",
