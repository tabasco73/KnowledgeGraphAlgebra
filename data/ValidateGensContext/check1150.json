                "Explanation": "The concept of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial is defined within the context of field theory, specifically concerning field extensions where a given polynomial can be completely factored into linear factors. This concept inherently involves fields, which are a type of algebraic structure characterized by the presence of two binary operations (addition and multiplication) satisfying certain properties including the existence of multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Factorial Ring or Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) pertains to the structure of integral domains, which are a type of ring. A UFD is defined by the property that every element (excluding zero and units) can be uniquely factored into irreducible (or prime) elements. This concept is crucial in ring theory, particularly in the study of the factorization properties within rings.\\n\\nThe definition and understanding of a Splitting Field do not rely on the properties of a UFD. While both concepts involve algebraic structures, they operate within different contexts (fields for Splitting Fields and rings for UFDs). The existence and properties of a Splitting Field are independent of whether the coefficients of the polynomial come from a UFD or any other type of ring. Therefore, the concept of a UFD is not necessary to define or understand a Splitting Field.",
