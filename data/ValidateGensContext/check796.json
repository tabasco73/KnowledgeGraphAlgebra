(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Ring Extension to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Ring Extension involves a pair (S, R), where S is described as a subring of R. This implies that both S and R must satisfy the properties of a Ring as defined.\\n\\n2. The term 'subring' inherently requires the understanding of what a Ring is, because a subring is a subset of a ring that itself forms a ring under the same operations. Without knowing what a Ring is, one cannot determine what constitutes a subring.\\n\\n3. Therefore, the concept of a Ring must be clearly defined and understood before one can define or understand what a Ring Extension is, as the latter concept builds directly on the structure and properties of a Ring.",
