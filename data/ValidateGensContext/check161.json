                "Explanation": "Kronecker's construction involves the creation of an extension field by taking the quotient of a polynomial ring over a base field by an ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. This process primarily involves concepts from the theory of rings, ideals, and polynomial rings. The construction is focused on the creation of a new field (extension field) rather than the examination or utilization of substructures within an existing ring.\\n\\nThe concept of a subring, on the other hand, involves identifying a subset of a ring that itself forms a ring under the same operations. While understanding subrings can enhance the overall grasp of ring theory, it is not directly necessary for defining or understanding Kronecker's construction. Kronecker's construction can be fully explained and understood using the concepts of rings, ideals, polynomial rings, and quotient rings without explicitly requiring the concept of subrings.",
