                "Explanation": "To determine the order of a group, one must be able to count the number of elements in the group. The concept of a group inherently involves the concept of a set, as a group is defined as a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses). Therefore, understanding what a set is, is fundamental to even defining what a group is. Since the order of a group is the number of elements in the group, and these elements form a set, the concept of a set is necessary to define the order of a group. Without the concept of a set, it would not be possible to conceptualize what it means for a group to have elements, let alone count them.",
