                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Polynomial Ring is necessary for defining a Splitting Field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield, we need to analyze the requirements of each concept.\\n\\n1. **Splitting Field Definition**: The definition of a splitting field involves a field $\\mathbb{F}$ where a given polynomial, in this case $X^q-X$, completely factorizes into linear factors. This definition inherently involves the concept of a polynomial since it specifies that the polynomial $X^q-X$ must split into linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}$. However, it does not explicitly require the structure of a polynomial ring; it primarily requires the existence of a field where the polynomial has roots.\\n\\n2. **Polynomial Ring Definition**: A polynomial ring R[X] is defined over a ring R and involves formal sums of powers of X with coefficients in R. This structure allows for the formal manipulation and construction of polynomials.\\n\\n3. **Connection Between Concepts**: While the concept of a polynomial ring provides a formal framework for dealing with polynomials, the definition of a splitting field focuses on the existence of a field where a specific polynomial splits into linear factors. The polynomial ring concept is useful for constructing and manipulating polynomials, but it is not strictly necessary for the definition of a splitting field, which is more concerned with the factorization properties of the polynomial within a field.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a polynomial ring, while related and useful for understanding polynomials, is not strictly necessary for the definition of a splitting field of $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield. The essential requirement for a splitting field is the field itself and the behavior of the polynomial within that field, not the formal structure of a polynomial ring.",
