            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Ring does not rely on the concept of a Field. According to the provided definitions, a Ring is defined independently with its own set of properties and rules, such as being a commutative group with respect to addition and a monoid with respect to multiplication. The definition of a Field, on the other hand, extends the concept of a Ring by adding the requirement of commutativity in multiplication and the existence of multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements, thus making it a commutative division ring. Therefore, the concept of a Ring can be fully defined without reference to or dependence on the concept of a Field.",
