                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Field is necessary for defining a Splitting Field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Splitting Field explicitly mentions that it is a field $\\mathbb{F}$ where the polynomial $X^q-X$ factorizes into linear factors. This implies that $\\mathbb{F}$ must satisfy the properties of a field to ensure that operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero) are well-defined and behave as expected in the context of polynomial factorization.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Field as a commutative division ring is crucial because it establishes the algebraic structure within which the polynomial $X^q-X$ can be factorized. Without the concept of a field, the operations necessary for factorization and the existence of inverses (which ensure that division by non-zero elements is possible) would not be clearly defined.\\n\\n3. The requirement that $\\mathbb{F}$ contains all zeros of $X^q-X$ and that these zeros are roots of the polynomial in $\\mathbb{F}$ further necessitates the field structure. This is because each zero must be an element of $\\mathbb{F}$, and the operations performed with these zeros (like evaluating the polynomial) must adhere to the rules of a field.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a Field is essential for the definition of a Splitting Field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield because it provides the necessary algebraic framework for polynomial factorization and the handling of its roots.",
