The definition of a subfield states that it is a subring $T$ of a field $K$ which is itself a field. This definition inherently relies on the understanding of what a field is, as it specifies that both $K$ and $T$ must be fields.\\n\\n2. The definition of a field is given as a commutative division ring. This provides the necessary characteristics that define what a field is, including its algebraic structure and properties.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that the definition of a subfield is dependent on the definition of a field. Without knowing what a field is, one cannot fully understand or apply the definition of a subfield, since the concept of a subfield directly involves the concept of a field. Therefore, the concept of a field must be defined and understood first before the concept of a subfield can be meaningfully discussed.",
