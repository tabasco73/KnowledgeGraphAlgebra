                "Explanation": "Kronecker's construction involves the concepts of polynomial rings, ideals, irreducible polynomials, and quotient fields, which are all fundamental concepts in the field of algebra, particularly in ring theory and field theory. The construction is used to extend a field by creating a new field in which a given irreducible polynomial has a root. This process does not inherently involve the concept of a subset as defined in set theory, where a subset is simply a set whose elements are all contained within another set. The construction focuses on algebraic structures and operations within those structures, such as forming quotient fields and manipulating polynomials and ideals, rather than on the relationship between sets as in the concept of a subset. Therefore, understanding or defining a subset is not necessary for understanding or defining Kronecker's construction.",
