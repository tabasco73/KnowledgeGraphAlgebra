            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a subring inherently depends on the existence of a ring. According to the provided definition, a subring is a subset S of a ring R that satisfies certain properties: it must be a subgroup with respect to addition and a submonoid with respect to multiplication, both operations being inherited from R. Without the concept of a ring, the definition of a subring would lack context and meaning because it wouldn't be clear what the operations of addition and multiplication are supposed to adhere to, nor would it be clear what structural properties (like associativity, distributivity, and the existence of a unit element) are required. Therefore, the concept of a ring must be defined and understood first before one can meaningfully define what a subring is.",
