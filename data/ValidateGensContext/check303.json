                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Field Extension is necessary for the definition of a Finite Field to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Finite Field focuses on the structure of a field with a finite number of elements, specifically $q = p^n$ where $p$ is a prime number and $n > 0$. This definition is self-contained and describes the characteristics of the field, including the number of elements and the nature of its arithmetic operations.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Field Extension involves a relationship between two fields, where one field is a subfield of another. This concept is about the extension of one field by another, creating a larger field structure.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that understanding a Finite Field does not inherently require the concept of a Field Extension. The definition of a Finite Field is complete with its own parameters and properties and does not rely on the existence or understanding of another field as a subfield or an extended field. Therefore, the concept of a Field Extension is not necessary to make sense of what a Finite Field is.",
