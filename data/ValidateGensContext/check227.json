                "Explanation": "The concept of the Image of a Ring Homomorphism involves understanding what the set $\\\\text{im} \\\\text{varphi}$, or $\\\\text{varphi}(R)$, consists of when a ring homomorphism $\\\\text{varphi}: R \\\\rightarrow R'$ is applied to all elements of a ring $R$. This set $\\\\text{varphi}(R)$ is a subset of $R'$ that retains the structure of a ring, meaning it is closed under addition and multiplication and contains the additive identity. The definition of a ring itself inherently includes the associative property for both addition and multiplication. However, the definition of the image of a ring homomorphism does not explicitly require the associative law to be defined separately because this property is already assumed as part of the ring structure in both $R$ and $R'$. The associative law is a fundamental property of the ring itself, not something that needs to be redefined or separately established when discussing ring homomorphisms or their images. Therefore, while the associative law is crucial for the underlying structure of rings, it does not need to be separately defined or established for the concept of the image of a ring homomorphism to make sense.",
