                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a subfield needs to be defined for the definition of a Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of the Galois Group. The definition of the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension involves the concept of a field extension, specifically $\\mathbb{F}_{q'} / \\mathbb{F}_q$. This notation inherently implies that $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$. The definition of the Galois Group also includes the requirement that the automorphisms fix $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which means they leave every element of $\\mathbb{F}_q$ unchanged while possibly changing elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ that are not in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This fixing condition is meaningful only if $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is understood to be a subfield of $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$. Therefore, the concept of a subfield is essential to understanding what it means for these automorphisms to fix $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and thus, it is necessary for the definition of the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension to be fully comprehensible.",
