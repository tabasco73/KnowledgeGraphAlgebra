                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Set is necessary for the definition of a Dihedral Group, we need to analyze the components of the Dihedral Group definition:\\n\\n1. The dihedral group $D_{n}$ is described as a group of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon. This implies a collection of elements (symmetries) which inherently forms a set.\\n\\n2. The group is generated by permutations $\\\\(\\sigma\\\\)$ and $\\tau$. Permutations are specific rearrangements of a set of objects, in this case, the vertices of the $n$-gon. Thus, the concept of permutations relies on the concept of a set.\\n\\n3. A group in mathematical terms is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies certain axioms (closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses). Therefore, the very definition of a group presupposes the existence of a set.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of a Set is fundamental to the definition of a Dihedral Group. Without the concept of a Set, the notion of permutations, collections of symmetries, and the structure of a group itself would not be well-defined.",
