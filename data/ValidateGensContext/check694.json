                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field Extension involves a relationship between two fields, where one field is a subfield of another. This concept is purely algebraic and pertains to the properties and operations within fields, such as addition, multiplication, and their respective identities and inverses.\\n\\nThe concept of the Order of a group pertains to group theory, specifically dealing with the number of elements in a group. This concept is relevant in the context of groups, which are algebraic structures defined by a single operation satisfying certain axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses).\\n\\nThere is no inherent or necessary connection between the concept of a Field Extension and the Order of a group. Field Extensions are concerned with field theory, which is a branch of abstract algebra dealing with fields, and not directly with groups or the number of elements in groups. Therefore, understanding or defining a Field Extension does not require knowledge or definition of the Order of a group.",
