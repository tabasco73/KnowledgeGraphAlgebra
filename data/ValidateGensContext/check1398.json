                "Explanation": "The definition of a Ring Epimorphism explicitly states that it is a type of ring homomorphism which is surjective. This means that the concept of a Ring Homomorphism is inherently required to define what a Ring Epimorphism is. Without understanding what a Ring Homomorphism is, one cannot fully comprehend the definition or the properties of a Ring Epimorphism, as the latter is a special case of the former where the function is surjective. Therefore, the concept of a Ring Homomorphism is essential and foundational for the definition of a Ring Epimorphism.",
