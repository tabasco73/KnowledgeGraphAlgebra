                "Explanation": "The concept of an integral element over a ring involves an element $b$ of a ring $B$ being expressible in terms of a ring $A$ through a ring homomorphism $\\\\[varphi: A \\\\longrightarrow B\\\\]$. The definition focuses on the existence of a monic polynomial $f \\\\in A[X]$ such that $f(b)=0$, or the finitely generated nature of certain submodules involving $b$. This definition inherently relies on the properties of rings and ring homomorphisms, but does not specifically require that any of the rings involved be a division ring.\\n\\nA division ring, by definition, is a ring in which every nonzero element is a unit. This property is specific to division rings and does not generally apply to all rings. The definition of an integral element over a ring does not necessitate that $A$ or $B$ be division rings; they only need to satisfy the general properties of rings (possibly with additional structure like being commutative, depending on context).\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a division ring is not necessary for the definition of an integral element over a ring to make sense. The essential requirements are the ring structures of $A$ and $B$ and the ring homomorphism between them, not the specific property of every element being invertible as in a division ring.",
