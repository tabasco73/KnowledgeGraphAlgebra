                "Explanation": "The concept of a Stabilizer is defined within the context of group actions, where a group $G$ acts on a set $X$. The stabilizer of a point $x \\n X$, denoted $G_x$, is the set of all elements in $G$ that leave $x$ unchanged under the group action. This definition inherently relies on the properties of a group, specifically the ability to perform actions on elements of a set.\\n\\nA Monoid, on the other hand, is a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element. While a group is a special type of monoid (one where every element also has an inverse), the definition of a stabilizer does not require the full structure of a monoid. It specifically requires a group, which is already a more structured concept than a monoid because of the requirement for inverses for each element.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a monoid is not necessary for the definition of a stabilizer. The stabilizer concept specifically requires a group, not just any monoid, because the definition of a stabilizer involves elements that must be invertible (as they need to return the point $x$ to itself, which implies an undoing or reversal of the action, something not generally possible in monoids).",
