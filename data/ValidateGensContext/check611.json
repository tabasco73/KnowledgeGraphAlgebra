            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of the Product of Ideals explicitly mentions that the ideals, denoted as \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{b}\\), are within a ring \\(R\\). Ideals are specific subsets of a ring that are closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of the ring. Therefore, the concept of a ring is fundamental to the definition of ideals. Without the structure of a ring, the operations and properties that define what an ideal is (and consequently, what the product of two ideals is) cannot be established. Thus, the concept of a ring is necessary for the definition of the Product of Ideals to make sense.",
