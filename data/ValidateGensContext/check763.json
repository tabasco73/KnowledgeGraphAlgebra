                "Explanation": "The concept of the Degree of a Polynomial is integral to defining the Minimal Polynomial. The definition of the Minimal Polynomial explicitly mentions it as the 'monic polynomial of lowest degree' that has a given element as a root. This implies that the concept of degree, which measures the highest power of the variable in a polynomial, is necessary to identify which polynomial among potentially many candidates qualifies as the minimal polynomial. Without the concept of degree, it would be impossible to determine which polynomial is of the 'lowest degree' as required by the definition of the Minimal Polynomial.",
