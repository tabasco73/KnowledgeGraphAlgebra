                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Field Extension is necessary for the definition of a Subfield, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Subfield states that a subring $T$ of a field $K$ is called a subfield if $T$ is a field itself. This definition requires the understanding of what a field and a subring are, but it does not explicitly require the concept of a Field Extension.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Field Extension involves a pair of fields $K \\subset L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This definition builds upon the concept of a subfield by specifying a relationship between two fields, where one is an extension of the other.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Subfield can be understood independently of the concept of a Field Extension. The definition of a Subfield does not rely on the notion of extension but rather on the properties of being a field itself within another field. Therefore, the concept of a Field Extension is not necessary for the definition of a Subfield to make sense.",
