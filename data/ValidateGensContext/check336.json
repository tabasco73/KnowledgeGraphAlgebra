                "Explanation": "To determine the order of a group, one must count the number of elements in the group. The concept of an 'element of a set' is fundamental in understanding what constitutes the group itself, as a group in mathematics is defined as a set with additional structure (such as an operation that satisfies certain properties). Without the concept of an 'element of a set,' it would be unclear what is being counted when referring to the 'number of elements' in the group. Therefore, the definition of the order of a group inherently relies on the understanding that a group is comprised of elements, each of which is an 'element of a set.' Thus, the concept of an 'element of a set' is necessary for the definition of the order of a group to make sense.",
