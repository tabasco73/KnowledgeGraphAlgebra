                "Explanation": "The definition of a Cycle explicitly references the symmetric group, denoted as \\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\). A cycle is defined as a permutation \\(\\pi\\) that belongs to \\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\), which is the symmetric group on \\(n\\) elements. The symmetric group \\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\) is defined as the group of all bijective self-maps of the set \\(\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\). Without the concept of the symmetric group, the definition of a cycle would lack context because it wouldn't be clear what set \\(\\pi\\) is a permutation of, or what properties such a permutation should have. Therefore, the concept of the symmetric group is necessary to fully understand and define what a cycle is in the context of permutations.",
