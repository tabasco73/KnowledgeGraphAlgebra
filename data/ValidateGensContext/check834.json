This definition is self-contained and does not inherently require the concept of the center of a group. The center of a group, defined as the set of all elements that commute with every element in the group, is a specific type of subgroup that is always normal, but it is not necessary to understand or define what a normal subgroup is. The concept of normality in subgroups is broader and does not depend on the elements of the subgroup commuting with all elements of the group, just that the subgroup's left and right cosets are the same. Therefore, understanding or defining a normal subgroup does not require prior knowledge or definition of the center of a group.",
