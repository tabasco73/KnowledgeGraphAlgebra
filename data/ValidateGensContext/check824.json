                "Explanation": "The concept of a Left Coset involves the formation of subsets within a group $G$ by multiplying a fixed element $a$ from $G$ with every element of a subgroup $H$. This process does not inherently require any properties of commutativity or central elements of the group, which are the focus of the concept of the Center. The Center of a group $G$ is defined as the set of all elements in $G$ that commute with every other element in $G$. This definition is concerned with the internal symmetries and commutative properties of the group, which are unrelated to the formation of cosets. Therefore, understanding or defining left cosets does not depend on the concept of the Center of the group. The definition and understanding of left cosets can be fully achieved without reference to or reliance on the concept of the Center.",
