            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Centralizer inherently relies on the concept of a group. According to the provided definition, the Centralizer of a subset $S$ in a group $G$ is defined as $Z_{S} = \\{x \\in G ; x s = s x \\text{ for all } s \\in S\\}$. This definition presupposes the existence of a group $G$ because it involves elements $x$ and $s$ that are part of $G$, and it uses the group operation (the product $xs$ and $sx$). Without the concept of a group, the operations and the very set $G$ from which $x$ and $s$ are chosen would not be defined. Therefore, the concept of a group is essential for the definition of a Centralizer to make sense, as it provides the structural and operational framework necessary for defining what it means for elements to 'centralize' a subset within that structure.",
