                "Explanation": "The definition of the Associative Law explicitly references a 'law of composition' on a set $M$. It states that this law is associative if the equation $(ab)c = a(bc)$ holds for all elements $a, b, c \\n M$. This equation involves the operation defined by the law of composition, specifically the operation '$ab$', which represents the image of the pair $(a, b)$ under the law of composition.\\n\\nWithout the concept of a law of composition, the operation '$ab$' would not be defined, and thus the equation $(ab)c = a(bc)$ would have no meaning. Therefore, the concept of a law of composition is necessary to provide the context and meaning for the operation used in the Associative Law. Without this foundational concept, the Associative Law cannot be understood or applied, as there would be no defined operation to associate.",
