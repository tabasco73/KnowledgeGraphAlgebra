(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Group involves a set with a single binary operation that satisfies certain properties: associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverses for every element. This definition is self-contained and does not require the concept of a Ring. A Ring, on the other hand, is a more complex structure that includes two binary operations (addition and multiplication) and requires the set to be a commutative group under addition and a monoid under multiplication, along with satisfying distributive laws. The definition of a Group does not depend on these additional structures and operations defined in a Ring. Therefore, understanding or defining a Group does not necessitate the concept of a Ring.",
