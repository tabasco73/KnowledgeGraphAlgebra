                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of a 'Cyclic group', we need to analyze the components of the definition of a cyclic group:\\n\\n1. A group $G$ is defined as cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. This implies that there exists at least one element in $G$ that, through the operations of the group, can generate every other element in the group.\\n\\n2. The definition mentions the existence of a surjective group homomorphism from $\\\\$\\mathbb{Z}\\\\$ to $G$. A homomorphism is a function between two groups that preserves the group operation. For this function to be surjective, every element in $G$ must be the image of at least one integer under this function.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is crucial. The definition of a cyclic group inherently involves the existence and properties of elements within the set $G$. Without understanding what an element of a set is, one cannot fully grasp the idea of a group being generated by a single element, nor can one understand the mapping of elements via the homomorphism.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of a 'Cyclic group' to be meaningful and complete.",
