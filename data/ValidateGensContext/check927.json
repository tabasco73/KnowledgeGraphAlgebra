                "Explanation": "The concept of a System of Generators of an Ideal is defined in the context of any ring $R$, where an ideal $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ of $R$ can be expressed as the sum of the ideals generated by a family of elements within $\\\\mathfrak{a}$. This definition does not require $R$ to have any specific properties related to factorization, such as being a unique factorization domain or a factorial ring.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Factorial Ring or Unique Factorization Domain (UFD) is a specific type of integral domain where every non-zero non-unit element can be uniquely factored into irreducibles, which are also primes. This property pertains to the factorization of elements within the ring, not to the structure of ideals or their generators.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a System of Generators of an Ideal do not depend on the ring $R$ being a UFD. The concept of generators of an ideal is applicable in any ring, regardless of whether it has unique factorization properties or not.",
