(ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$.

                "Explanation": "The concept of a Group is defined independently of the concept of a Subring. A Group is defined as a set with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element, and where every element has an inverse. This definition is self-contained and does not require any reference to rings or subrings.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Subring is a concept that arises within the context of ring theory. It refers to a subset of a ring that itself forms a ring under the same operations as the larger ring. The definition of a Subring depends on the existence of a ring, but it does not influence the definition of a Group.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a Group does not depend on the concept of a Subring, and the concept of a Subring is not necessary for the definition of a Group to make sense.",
