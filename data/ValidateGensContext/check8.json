                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Monoid Homomorphism to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Monoid Homomorphism involves two monoids, $G$ and $G^{\\prime}$, and a map $\\nvarphi: G \\nlongrightarrow G^{\\prime}$ that satisfies certain properties. Specifically, it requires that $\\nvarphi(ab) = \\nvarphi(a) \\nvarphi(b)$ for all $a, b \\nin G$. This condition directly implies the existence of a binary operation (law of composition) in both $G$ and $G^{\\prime}$, as it involves the operation $ab$ in $G$ and $\\nvarphi(a) \\nvarphi(b)$ in $G^{\\prime}$.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Law of Composition describes it as a map from $M \\ntimes M$ to $M$, which assigns a product $ab$ to each pair $(a, b)$. This is exactly the type of operation used in the definition of a Monoid Homomorphism.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of a Law of Composition is essential for defining the operations within a Monoid, and consequently, for defining what it means for a map between two Monoids to be a homomorphism. Without a Law of Composition, the operation $ab$ in $G$ and $\\nvarphi(a) \\nvarphi(b)$ in $G^{\\prime}$ would not be well-defined, making the concept of a Monoid Homomorphism nonsensical.",
