                "Explanation": "The definition of an integral element over a ring explicitly mentions the need for a ring homomorphism. According to the provided definition, an element $b \\in B$ is integral over $A$ with respect to a ring homomorphism $\\varphi: A \\longrightarrow B$. This indicates that the concept of a ring homomorphism is inherently required to define what it means for $b$ to be integral over $A$. The ring homomorphism $\\varphi$ is essential because it establishes how elements of $A$ are interpreted or mapped into $B$, which is crucial for determining whether $b$ satisfies the conditions of being integral, such as satisfying a monic polynomial equation with coefficients in $A$. Without the concept of a ring homomorphism, the relationship between $A$ and $B$ and the action of $A$ on $B$ through $b$ would not be well-defined, making it impossible to assess whether $b$ is integral over $A$. Therefore, the concept of a ring homomorphism is necessary for the definition of an integral element over a ring.",
