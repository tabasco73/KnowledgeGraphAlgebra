                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a ring automorphism to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a ring automorphism.\\n\\n1. A ring automorphism is defined as an isomorphism between a ring $R$ and itself, denoted as $\\varphi: R \\longrightarrow R$.\\n2. A ring, by definition, is a set equipped with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties.\\n3. An isomorphism, in the context of ring theory, is a bijective function that preserves the ring operations. This function maps elements from one ring to another (or in the case of an automorphism, from a ring to itself).\\n4. The concept of a function, and specifically a bijective function, inherently relies on the concept of sets, as a function is defined as a mapping from one set to another set.\\n5. Therefore, the definition of a ring automorphism inherently relies on the concept of a ring as a set with additional structure, and the concept of a function as a mapping between sets.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a set is fundamental to the definition of a ring automorphism, as without the concept of sets, the notions of rings and functions would not be well-defined.",
