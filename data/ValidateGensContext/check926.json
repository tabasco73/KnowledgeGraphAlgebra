                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Algebraic Field Extension is necessary for defining a Splitting Field of a Family of Polynomials, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Splitting Field of a Family of Polynomials states that it is a field $L$ extending $K$ where every polynomial in the family decomposes into linear factors in $L$, and the extension $L/K$ is generated by the zeros of these polynomials.\\n\\n2. The definition of an Algebraic Field Extension specifies that an extension field $L$ over $K$ is algebraic if every element in $L$ is algebraic over $K$, meaning each element in $L$ is a root of some non-zero polynomial in $K[x]$.\\n\\n3. The definition of a Splitting Field inherently implies that $L$ contains elements that are roots of polynomials over $K$, specifically the zeros of the polynomials in the family. Since these elements generate $L$, and each is a root of a polynomial over $K$, every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$. Thus, the extension $L/K$ in the context of a Splitting Field is always an Algebraic Field Extension.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of an Algebraic Field Extension is inherently required to fully understand and define a Splitting Field of a Family of Polynomials, as it ensures that the elements generating $L$ are algebraic over $K$.",
