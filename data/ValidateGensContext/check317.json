                "Explanation": "The definition of a Zero Ring specifies that it is a ring where the additive identity (0) and the multiplicative identity (1) are the same, meaning 1=0. This definition inherently implies that the ring consists of a single element, 0, since all elements must be equal to the identity element. In such a ring, any operation between elements (which are all 0) will yield the same result, regardless of the order of the operation. Therefore, the operation is trivially commutative because there is only one element to operate with, and 0*0 = 0 = 0*0.\\n\\nThe Commutative Law states that a law of composition on a set $M$ is commutative if $ab = ba$ for all elements $a, b \\\\$in M$. In the context of the Zero Ring, since there is only one element, any operation is automatically commutative. Thus, the concept of the Commutative Law does not need to be explicitly defined for the definition of a Zero Ring to make sense, as the commutativity is inherently satisfied by the nature of the ring having only one element.",
