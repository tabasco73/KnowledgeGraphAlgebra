If $G$ is a group, $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if in addition, (iii) $a \\in H \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\in H$. In particular, a subgroup of a group $G$ is a submonoid that is closed under the process of taking inverses. In defining a subgroup $H \\subset G$, condition (i) can be weakened by simply requiring $H \\neq \\emptyset$, since this implies $e \\in H$ using (ii) and (iii). Of course, similar reasoning is not possible for monoids. Every group $G$ admits $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ as trivial subgroups. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the set $m \\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integral multiples of $m$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}$. We will see in 1.3/4 that all subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of this type. More generally, every element $a$ of a group $G$ gives rise to a so-called cyclic subgroup of $G$. It consists of all powers $a^{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where we put $a^{n}=\\left(a^{-1}\\right)^{-n}$ for $n<0; see also Section 1.3."

                "Explanation": "The concept of a subgroup is defined within the context of group theory, where a subgroup is a subset of a group that itself satisfies the group axioms. The definition of a subgroup does not inherently require the concept of a symmetric group. A symmetric group is a specific type of group, one that consists of all the permutations of a finite set. While understanding subgroups within the context of symmetric groups can provide valuable examples and insights into the structure and properties of groups in general, the definition and existence of subgroups do not depend on the concept of symmetric groups. Subgroups can be defined and exist in any group, regardless of whether that group is symmetric or not. Therefore, the concept of a symmetric group is not necessary for the definition of a subgroup to make sense.",
