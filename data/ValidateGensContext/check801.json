(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Ring is necessary for defining an Algebraic Field Extension, we need to analyze the relationship between fields, rings, and field extensions.\\n\\n1. **Definition of a Field**: A field is a special kind of ring that has additional properties. Specifically, a field is a commutative ring with unity (unit element) where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. This means that every field is inherently a ring, but with extra conditions.\\n\\n2. **Field Extension**: A field extension occurs when one field is contained within another larger field. The smaller field is called the base field, and the larger field is called the extension field. The concept of a field extension inherently involves two fields.\\n\\n3. **Algebraic Field Extension**: An algebraic field extension specifically refers to a field extension where every element of the extension field is algebraic over the base field, meaning each element in the extension field is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in the base field.\\n\\n4. **Necessity of Ring Concept**: Since fields are a subset of rings, understanding and defining fields (and thus field extensions) inherently requires the concept of rings. The properties and operations within a field (addition and multiplication, which are also defined in rings) are fundamental to discussing and defining field extensions. Therefore, the concept of a ring is essential as a foundational element in the definition of fields and, subsequently, field extensions.",
