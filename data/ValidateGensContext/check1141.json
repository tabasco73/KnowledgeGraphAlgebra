                "Explanation": "The definition of a Galois extension explicitly states that the extension must be separable. This implies that the extension involves separable polynomials, as a field extension is separable if every element of the extension field is the root of a separable polynomial over the base field. Therefore, the concept of a separable polynomial is inherently required to understand and define what a separable extension is, and thus, what a Galois extension is. Without the concept of separable polynomials, we cannot fully define or understand the separability condition in the context of Galois extensions.",
