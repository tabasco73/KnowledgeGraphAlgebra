            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Division Ring to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Division Ring states that it is a type of ring, specifically, 'A ring R is called a division ring...'. This implies that the concept of a Division Ring is a specialized or extended concept based on the general concept of a Ring.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Ring provides the foundational properties and operations (addition and multiplication, along with their associative, distributive, and unit element properties) that are assumed to exist and behave in a certain way in a Division Ring.\\n\\n3. Without the definition of a Ring, the properties and operations assumed in a Division Ring would lack a foundational basis, making the concept unclear and undefined in terms of the operations it supports and the properties those operations must satisfy.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a Ring must be defined and understood first before one can fully comprehend and define what a Division Ring is, as the latter builds directly upon the structural and operational framework established by the former.",
