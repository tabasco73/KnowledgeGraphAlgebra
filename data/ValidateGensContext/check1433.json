                "Explanation": "The concept of a Splitting Field of a Family of Polynomials inherently involves the idea of an extension field. According to the definition provided, a splitting field of a family of polynomials \\(\\mathfrak{F}=(f_i)_{i \\in I}, f_i \\in K[X]\\) over a field \\(K\\) is a field \\(L\\) that extends \\(K\\). This means that \\(L\\) is an extension field of \\(K\\). The definition of a splitting field explicitly states that \\(L\\) must be a field that extends \\(K\\), and the properties of the polynomials \\(f_i\\) being completely factorizable in \\(L\\) and the extension being generated by the zeros of these polynomials are central to the concept of a splitting field. Therefore, the concept of an extension field is necessary to define a splitting field because without the notion of one field extending another, the definition of a splitting field would not be meaningful or complete.",
