                "Explanation": "The definition of the degree of a polynomial explicitly references the polynomial ring R[X]. It states that a polynomial f is an element of R[X], and the degree of this polynomial is defined based on the coefficients a_i of the polynomial in R[X]. The polynomial ring R[X] provides the structure and the elements (polynomials) for which the concept of degree is defined. Without the definition of a polynomial ring, the elements (polynomials) and their structure would not be formally established, making the definition of the degree of a polynomial ambiguous or undefined. Therefore, the concept of a polynomial ring is necessary to properly define and understand the degree of a polynomial.",
