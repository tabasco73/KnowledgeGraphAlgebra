                "Explanation": "Kronecker's construction involves extending a field by forming a quotient of the polynomial ring over the base field by an ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. This process inherently relies on the properties of fields, specifically the commutative property of multiplication in fields. A division ring, or skew field, is similar to a field in that every nonzero element is a unit, but it does not necessarily have commutative multiplication. The definition of Kronecker's construction does not require the non-commutative aspect of a division ring; it specifically involves fields which are a special case of commutative division rings. Therefore, the concept of a division ring is not necessary for the definition of Kronecker's construction to make sense, as the construction uses fields (which are inherently commutative division rings) and does not extend to non-commutative contexts.",
