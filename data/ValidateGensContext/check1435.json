                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Splitting Field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield is necessary for the definition of a Finite Field, we need to analyze the relationship between these two concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Finite Field**: A finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is defined as a field with $q = p^n$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number and $n > 0$. This definition focuses on the number of elements in the field and its algebraic structure as a field (having no zero divisors and every non-zero element having a multiplicative inverse).\\n\\n2. **Definition of Splitting Field**: A field $\\mathbb{F}$ is a splitting field of the polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$ if $X^q-X$ factorizes completely into linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}$. This means that $\\mathbb{F}$ contains all the roots of $X^q-X$.\\n\\n3. **Relationship Between the Concepts**: While it is true that for a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (a finite field), the polynomial $X^q-X$ will indeed split into linear factors (since every element in $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a root of $X^q-X$), the definition of a finite field itself does not inherently require the concept of a splitting field. The definition of a finite field is based on its cardinality and field properties, independent of the behavior of any specific polynomial.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: The concept of a splitting field of $X^q-X$ is related to the properties of finite fields (since finite fields do exhibit this polynomial splitting), but it is not a prerequisite for defining what a finite field is. The definition of a finite field stands alone with its focus on the number of elements and the field structure.",
