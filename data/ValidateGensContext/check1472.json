This implies that the concept of a set is integral to understanding what a codomain is, as it uses the idea of a collection of objects (outputs in this case) grouped together as an entity. Without the concept of a set, the notion of a codomain would lack a framework to describe how these outputs are collectively handled and defined. Therefore, the concept of a set is necessary to fully define and comprehend what a codomain is.",
