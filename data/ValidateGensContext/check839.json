                "Explanation": "The concept of a Minimal Polynomial is defined as the unique monic polynomial of the smallest degree in the base field that has a given element as a root. This definition is self-contained and does not inherently require the concept of a Splitting Field. The definition of a Minimal Polynomial focuses on the existence of a polynomial within the base field that zeros at a specific element in a field extension, and it does not necessitate that the polynomial splits into linear factors or that all roots of the polynomial are present in the field.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Splitting Field, specifically for the polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield, involves a field that contains all roots of the polynomial, and where the polynomial splits completely into linear factors. This concept is more about the behavior of the polynomial across an extension field rather than focusing on a specific root and its minimal polynomial.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a Minimal Polynomial do not depend on the concept of a Splitting Field. The Minimal Polynomial can be defined and understood entirely independently of whether the polynomial splits completely in any extension field.",
