                "Explanation": "The definition of an irreducible element specifically requires the structure to be an integral domain. An integral domain is a special type of commutative ring that has no zero divisors. Therefore, the concept of a commutative ring is inherently necessary because an integral domain cannot be defined without first defining a commutative ring. The definition of an irreducible element does not directly mention a commutative ring, but it relies on the concept of an integral domain, which in turn relies on the concept of a commutative ring. Thus, the concept of a commutative ring is indirectly but essentially required for the definition of an irreducible element to make sense.",
