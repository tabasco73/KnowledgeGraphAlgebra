            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "A transposition is defined as a 2-cycle, which is a concept from the theory of permutations. Permutations themselves are functions that rearrange the elements of a set, and they form a group under the operation of composition. This group is known as the symmetric group. The definition of a transposition inherently relies on the concept of a permutation, which in turn is fundamentally linked to the concept of a group because permutations form a group under composition. Therefore, understanding what a group is, is essential to fully grasp the concept of a transposition as a 2-cycle within the context of group theory. Without the concept of a group, the structural and operational properties that define how permutations (and thus transpositions) interact would not be established, making the concept of a transposition incomplete or nonsensical.",
