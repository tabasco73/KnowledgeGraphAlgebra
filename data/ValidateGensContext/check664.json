                "Explanation": "The definition of a Normalizer involves the concept of a subset $S$ which is part of a group $G$. A subset is inherently a type of set, specifically a set that contains elements all of which are also elements of a larger set, in this case, the group $G$. Therefore, understanding what a set is becomes crucial to comprehending what a subset is. Since the normalizer $N_{S}$ is defined using the subset $S$, the concept of a set must first be understood to grasp the definition of a normalizer. Thus, the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a normalizer to make sense.",
