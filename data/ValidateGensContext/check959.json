            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Normalizer inherently relies on the concept of a group. According to the provided definition, the normalizer of a subset $S$ in a group $G$ is defined as $N_{S}=\\{x \\in G ; x S=S x\\}$. This definition presupposes the existence of a group $G$, as it involves elements $x$ from $G$ and the operation of group multiplication to form the products $xS$ and $Sx$. Without the concept of a group, the operations and the set $G$ mentioned in the definition of the normalizer would not have a well-defined meaning. Therefore, the concept of a group is essential for the definition of a normalizer to make sense.",
