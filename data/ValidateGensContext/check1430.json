                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a field extension is necessary for the definition of an algebraically closed field, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of an algebraically closed field focuses on the properties of polynomials within a single field $K$. It states that every nonconstant polynomial in $K[X]$ must have a zero in $K$ itself, and that such a polynomial can be completely factored into linear factors within $K$. This definition is self-contained and does not inherently require any reference to another field $L$ or the concept of a field extension.\\n\\n2. The concept of a field extension involves two fields, $K$ and $L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This concept is used to discuss properties and relationships between two different fields, which is not directly required by the definition of an algebraically closed field.\\n\\nFrom these observations, it is clear that the definition of an algebraically closed field does not depend on the concept of a field extension. The definition of an algebraically closed field is concerned solely with the properties of polynomials and their zeros within the same field $K$, without any need to consider another field $L$ or the relationship between $K$ and $L$.",
