                "Explanation": "The definition of the sign or signature of a permutation explicitly references the symmetric group, denoted as \\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\). The sign of a permutation \\(\\pi\\) is defined for permutations that are elements of the symmetric group \\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\). Therefore, the concept of the symmetric group is essential for defining the domain of the function that assigns a sign to a permutation. Without the concept of the symmetric group, the definition of the sign of a permutation would lack a clear and necessary context, as it would be unclear what set of permutations the sign function applies to. Thus, the concept of a symmetric group is needed for the definition of the sign or signature of a permutation to make sense.",
