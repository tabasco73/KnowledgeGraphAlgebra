                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a monoid is necessary for the definition of a submonoid to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a submonoid explicitly states, 'Let $G$ be a monoid.' This indicates that the concept of a submonoid is based on the existence of a monoid $G$. The subset $H$ of $G$ is considered a submonoid if it includes the unit element of $G$ and is closed under the operation defined in $G$.\\n\\n2. The definition of a monoid describes a set $M$ with a specific law of composition that is associative and has a unit element. This structure is fundamental as it provides the framework (associativity and the presence of a unit element) within which a submonoid operates.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a monoid, the definition of a submonoid would lack context and meaning because it relies on the properties of a monoid (associativity of the operation and the existence of a unit element) to define the conditions that $H$ must satisfy to be a submonoid.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a monoid is essential for the definition of a submonoid, as the latter is a subset that inherits and respects the structural properties of the monoid it is derived from.",
