                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a simple field extension, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a simple field extension:\\n\\n1. A field extension $K \\subset L$ implies that both $K$ and $L$ are fields. Fields, by definition, are sets with additional algebraic structure (addition and multiplication operations that satisfy certain axioms).\\n\\n2. The notation $K(\\alpha)$ represents the smallest field containing both $K$ and the element $\\alpha$. This notation inherently involves the concept of a set because it refers to a collection of elements (all possible expressions formed using $\\alpha$ and elements of $K$ under field operations).\\n\\n3. The element $\\alpha \\in L$ also uses the concept of set membership, indicating that $\\alpha$ is an element of the set $L$.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the definition of a simple field extension relies on the concept of sets, as both fields and the operations within them are fundamentally set-based concepts. Therefore, understanding and defining fields (and by extension, field extensions) requires the concept of a set.",
