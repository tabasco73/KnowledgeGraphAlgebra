                "Explanation": "The concept of the Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields involves the group of automorphisms of the splitting field that fix the base field. These automorphisms form a group under the operation of composition. For any set of operations to form a group, they must satisfy certain properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.\\n\\nThe Associative Law specifically states that a law of composition on a set is associative if $(ab)c = a(bc)$ for all elements $a, b, c$ in the set. This law is crucial for the definition of a group because one of the fundamental properties of a group is that the operation must be associative.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of the Associative Law is inherently required for the definition of a Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields, as the group of automorphisms must satisfy the associative property to be considered a group. Without the Associative Law, the set of automorphisms would not necessarily form a group, and thus the concept of the Galois Group would not be well-defined.",
