                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a 'System of generators' is necessary for the definition of a 'Free A-module' to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a 'Free A-module' states that it is an A-module M which has a basis, specifically referred to as a 'free system of generators'. This implies that the elements of the basis can generate the entire module M.\\n\\n2. The definition of a 'System of generators' describes a family of elements (x_i)_{i in I} in an A-module M that generates M, meaning M is the sum of all A-linear combinations of these elements.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a 'System of generators' directly supports the understanding of what it means for a module to have a basis in the context of being a 'Free A-module'. The basis in a free module is essentially a special kind of system of generators\u2014one that not only generates the module but does so in such a way that each element of the module can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the basis elements.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a 'System of generators' is crucial for defining what a basis is in the context of a 'Free A-module'. Without understanding how a system of generators works, one cannot fully grasp what it means for a module to have a basis, and thus to be free.",
