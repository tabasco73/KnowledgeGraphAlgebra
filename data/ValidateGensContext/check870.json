                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a separable polynomial, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a separable polynomial:\\n\\n1. A separable polynomial is defined as having distinct roots in its splitting field. This implies that each root of the polynomial is unique and does not repeat.\\n\\n2. The concept of distinctness and uniqueness of roots inherently relies on the idea of comparing elements and ensuring no repetitions. This is fundamentally a set-theoretic concept, as a set is defined as a collection of distinct objects.\\n\\n3. The roots of a polynomial, when considered in the context of a splitting field, form a set of elements (the set of roots). The property of these roots being distinct (i.e., no two roots are the same) aligns with the definition of a set, which emphasizes the distinctness of its elements.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of a set, the notion of 'distinct roots' would lack a formal framework for understanding and representation, as the mathematical structure to describe collections of unique items wouldn't be clearly defined.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a set is essential for the definition of a separable polynomial, as it provides the necessary framework to define and understand the distinctness of roots in a polynomial.",
