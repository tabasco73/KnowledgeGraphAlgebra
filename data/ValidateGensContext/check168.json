                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield is necessary for the definition of a separable polynomial, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Separable Polynomial**: Defined as a polynomial that has distinct roots in its splitting field. This definition inherently requires the concept of a splitting field, but it does not specify that the polynomial in question must be $X^q-X$ or that the splitting field must be over its prime subfield. The definition of a separable polynomial is general and applies to any polynomial.\\n\\n2. **Splitting Field of $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield**: This is a specific instance of a splitting field for a specific polynomial $X^q-X$. The definition states that such a field contains all zeros of $X^q-X$ and that the polynomial factorizes into linear factors in this field.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that while the concept of a splitting field is crucial for defining a separable polynomial, the specific polynomial $X^q-X$ and its splitting field over the prime subfield are not necessary for the general concept of a separable polynomial. The definition of a separable polynomial does not rely on this specific polynomial or field but rather on the broader concept of a splitting field where the polynomial has distinct roots.",
