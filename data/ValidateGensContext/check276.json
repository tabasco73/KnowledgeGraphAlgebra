                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the Commutative Law needs to be defined for the definition of a Ring Endomorphism to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. A Ring Endomorphism is defined as a homomorphism from a ring $R$ to itself, $\\\\[\\varphi: R \\longrightarrow R\\\\b].\\n2. A homomorphism in the context of ring theory is a function that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication).\\n3. The definition of a Ring Endomorphism does not explicitly require the ring $R$ to be commutative. The ring could be either commutative or non-commutative.\\n4. The Commutative Law states that a law of composition on a set $M$ is commutative if $ab = ba$ for all elements $a, b \\\\[\\in M\\\\b]. This law pertains to the nature of the operation within the set.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the definition of a Ring Endomorphism does not depend on whether the ring operations are commutative. The concept of a Ring Endomorphism is concerned with the preservation of the ring operations under a function, regardless of whether these operations are commutative. Therefore, the Commutative Law does not need to be defined for the definition of a Ring Endomorphism to make sense.",
