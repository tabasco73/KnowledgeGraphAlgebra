                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the Commutative Law needs to be defined for the definition of a Principal Ideal Domain (PID) to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Principal Ideal Domain**: The definition states that a ring $R$ is a PID if it is an integral domain and every ideal of $R$ is principal. An integral domain, by definition, is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero.\\n\\n2. **Commutative Law**: This law states that a law of composition on a set $M$ is commutative if $ab = ba$ for all elements $a, b \\\\$in M$.\\n\\nFrom the definition of an integral domain, it is clear that the ring must be commutative. Therefore, the concept of the Commutative Law is inherently required for the definition of an integral domain, which in turn is essential for defining a PID. Without the ring being commutative, it cannot be an integral domain, and consequently, it cannot be a PID.\\n\\nThus, the concept of the Commutative Law is necessary for the definition of a PID to be complete and coherent.",
