                "Explanation": "Kronecker's construction involves the use of a polynomial ring and the ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. The concept of the degree of a polynomial is crucial in determining whether a polynomial is irreducible. Irreducibility of a polynomial, which is a key aspect in Kronecker's construction, often depends on the degree of the polynomial. For instance, certain tests for irreducibility apply only to polynomials of specific degrees. Moreover, the degree of the polynomial also influences the structure and properties of the resulting extension field, such as its dimension over the base field. Therefore, understanding and defining the degree of a polynomial is essential for applying Kronecker's construction effectively.",
