                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of the 'Commutative Law' to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definition of the Commutative Law.\\n\\nThe definition of the Commutative Law states that a law of composition on a set $M$ is commutative if $ab = ba$ for all elements $a, b \\in M$. This definition inherently relies on the concept of elements $a$ and $b$ being part of the set $M$. The notation $a, b \\in M$ directly refers to $a$ and $b$ as elements of the set $M$.\\n\\nWithout the concept of an 'Element of a Set', we would not have a clear understanding of what it means for $a$ and $b$ to be in $M$. The relationship $ab = ba$ would lose its meaning because it would not be clear what $a$ and $b$ are or how they relate to the set $M$. Thus, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is crucial for providing the necessary context and meaning to the elements involved in the Commutative Law.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is needed for the definition of a 'Commutative Law' to make sense, as it provides the foundational understanding of what constitutes the elements that are being operated on within the set.",
