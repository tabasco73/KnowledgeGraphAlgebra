                "Explanation": "The definition of a prime ideal does not explicitly require the ring $R$ to be commutative. A prime ideal is defined as a proper ideal $\\mathfrak{p} \\subsetneq R$ such that if $ab \\in \\mathfrak{p}$, then either $a \\in \\mathfrak{p}$ or $b \\in \\mathfrak{p}$, for any $a, b \\in R$. This definition focuses on the containment relationship between the product of elements and the ideal itself, and does not depend on the order of multiplication of elements $a$ and $b$. \\n\\nThe Commutative Law, which states that $ab = ba$ for all elements $a, b$ in a set $M$, is not necessary for the definition of a prime ideal to hold. Prime ideals can exist in both commutative and non-commutative rings. The essential aspect of the definition of a prime ideal is the implication condition related to the elements and the ideal, not the commutativity of the ring. Therefore, the Commutative Law does not need to be defined or assumed for the definition of a prime ideal to make sense.",
