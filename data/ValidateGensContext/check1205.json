                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Set is needed for the definition of a Trivial Algebraic field extension, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a Trivial Algebraic field extension. The definition states that an algebraic field extension $L / K$ is trivial if every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$. Here, $L$ and $K$ are both fields, and a field is a particular kind of set that satisfies certain algebraic properties (like having addition and multiplication operations that follow specific rules). \\n\\nIn the definition of a Trivial Algebraic field extension, the concept of a set is inherently used because fields are sets with additional structure. The extension $L / K$ implies a relationship between two sets (fields) where elements of one set ($L$) are related to elements of another set ($K$) through algebraic expressions. Therefore, understanding and defining fields (and hence field extensions) fundamentally relies on the concept of sets, as fields cannot exist without the underlying set structure. \\n\\nThus, the concept of a Set is necessary to properly define what a field is, and consequently, to define what a Trivial Algebraic field extension is.",
