                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a K-homomorphism is necessary for the definition of a Galois extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Galois Extension**: An extension \\(K_r / K\\) is Galois if it is both normal and separable. This definition involves the concepts of normality and separability but does not explicitly mention K-homomorphisms.\\n\\n2. **Normal Extension**: An extension is normal if it is the splitting field of a polynomial over the base field. This concept involves the roots of a polynomial and their behavior under field automorphisms, but it does not require the explicit definition of a K-homomorphism.\\n\\n3. **Separable Extension**: An extension is separable if the minimal polynomial of every element in the extension field has distinct roots. This concept is related to the polynomial's behavior under derivation and does not inherently require the concept of K-homomorphisms.\\n\\n4. **K-homomorphism**: This is a field homomorphism that restricts to the identity on the base field K. While K-homomorphisms are relevant in the study of field extensions, particularly in understanding automorphisms of extensions, the basic definition of a Galois extension as normal and separable does not inherently require the concept of K-homomorphisms.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the definition of a Galois extension, which requires the extension to be normal and separable, does not inherently depend on the concept of a K-homomorphism. K-homomorphisms are useful in further analysis and properties of Galois extensions, especially in understanding the Galois group, but they are not necessary for the basic definition of what constitutes a Galois extension.",
