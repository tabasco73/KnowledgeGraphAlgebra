                "Explanation": "The concept of a Factor Group is defined within the context of group theory, specifically dealing with groups and normal subgroups. It involves the construction of a new group from the cosets of a normal subgroup in a given group, using a specific group operation. This concept is purely within the realm of group theory and does not inherently involve any concepts from ring theory or algebra over a ring.\\n\\nOn the other hand, an Algebra over a Ring involves structures that are both rings and modules over another ring, and it deals with ring homomorphisms that are compatible with a given ring structure. This concept is part of ring theory and algebra, and it specifically involves the interaction between rings and modules, not directly related to the structure or operations within group theory.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a Factor Group do not require the concept of an Algebra over a Ring. These are separate areas within abstract algebra, and one does not depend on the other for its definition or understanding.",
