                "Explanation": "The concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension involves a field extension $K \\subset L$ where $L$ can be generated by adjoining finitely many elements from $L$ to $K$. This concept focuses on the ability to express $L$ as a field that includes $K$ and some additional elements that can be algebraically expressed in terms of $K$. \\n\\nOn the other hand, Kronecker's Construction is a specific method of constructing field extensions by using the quotient of a polynomial ring by an ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. This method is one of several ways to construct field extensions, particularly useful for constructing extensions where the new elements are zeros of a given polynomial. \\n\\nHowever, the definition of a Finitely Generated Field Extension does not inherently require the use of Kronecker's Construction. While Kronecker's Construction provides a mechanism for creating such extensions, a Finitely Generated Field Extension can exist and be defined without specifically using or referencing Kronecker's method. The concept of finitely generating a field extension is broader and can be achieved through various other methods as well, such as simple algebraic adjunctions not necessarily involving the quotient of polynomial rings.",
