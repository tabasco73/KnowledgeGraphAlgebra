                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a normal subgroup to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a normal subgroup:\\n\\n1. A normal subgroup involves a subgroup $H$ and a group $G$. Both $H$ and $G$ are themselves sets, as a group is defined as a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses).\\n\\n2. The definition of a normal subgroup states that $H \\subset G$, indicating that $H$ is a subset of $G$. The concept of a subset is inherently tied to the concept of sets, as a subset is defined as a set containing some or all elements of another set.\\n\\n3. The condition $aH = Ha$ for all $a \\in G$ involves the operation of forming cosets, which are also sets. The left coset $aH$ is the set of all products $ah$ where $h \\in H$, and similarly for the right coset $Ha$.\\n\\n4. The equality of sets $aH$ and $Ha$ for all elements $a$ in $G$ further uses the concept of set equality, which is the condition where two sets have the same elements.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the definition of a normal subgroup relies heavily on the concept of sets, as it uses sets in the form of groups, subsets, and cosets, and operations on these sets. Without the concept of sets, these elements would not have a well-defined meaning, making the definition of a normal subgroup nonsensical.",
