            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of an 'Ideal corresponding to a subset' involves the concept of a polynomial ring, which is a specific type of ring. In this definition, the ideal consists of all polynomials (elements of the polynomial ring) that vanish on a given subset. A polynomial ring, such as \\(K[X]\\), is a ring structured around a field \\(K\\) and indeterminates like \\(X\\), and it adheres to the properties of a ring as defined in the concept of a 'Ring'.\\n\\nFor the definition of an ideal to make sense, it is crucial to understand what a ring is because the polynomial ring, in which the ideal resides, must satisfy the properties of a ring. These properties include operations like addition and multiplication, which follow specific associative, commutative, and distributive laws. Without the foundational concept of a ring, the structure and operations within the polynomial ring, and consequently the definition of the ideal, would not be properly defined or understood.",
