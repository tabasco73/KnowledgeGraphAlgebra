            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of the order of an element explicitly references a group $G$. It states that the order of an element $a$ in a group $G$ is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $a^m = 1$, where $1$ is the identity element of the group. This definition inherently relies on the concept of a group because it involves operations (like the exponentiation of an element and the identity element) that are defined within the context of group theory. Without the structure of a group, these operations and the concept of an identity element do not necessarily exist. Therefore, the concept of a group must be defined and understood for the definition of the order of an element to make sense.",
