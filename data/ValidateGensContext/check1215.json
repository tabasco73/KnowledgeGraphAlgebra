                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for defining a 'Trivial Algebraic field extension', we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a 'Trivial Algebraic field extension' states that it is an extension where every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This implies that $L$ and $K$ are sets (specifically, fields, which are a special kind of set in mathematics).\\n\\n2. The definition explicitly uses the term 'element' when referring to the members of the set $L$. This indicates that the concept of an element being part of a set is fundamental to understanding what it means for every element of $L$ to be algebraic over $K'.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of an 'Element of a Set', we would not be able to specify what it means for 'every element of $L$'. The notion of elements belonging to a set is crucial in defining the relationship and operations within the field extension.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is essential for the definition of a 'Trivial Algebraic field extension' to make sense, as it underpins the basic structure of what $L$ and $K$ are and how their elements interact.",
