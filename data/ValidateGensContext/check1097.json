                "Explanation": "The definition of a field as provided states that a field is a commutative division ring. This definition focuses on the algebraic structure of the field itself, specifying that it must be both commutative (the order of multiplication does not matter) and a division ring (every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse).\\n\\nThe concept of a ring isomorphism, on the other hand, pertains to the relationship between two rings. It defines when two rings can be considered structurally the same in the context of ring theory, specifically through the existence of a bijective ring homomorphism that has an inverse also being a ring homomorphism.\\n\\nTo understand or define what a field is, one does not need to reference or use the concept of ring isomorphism. The definition of a field is self-contained with respect to its algebraic properties and does not inherently involve the comparison or mapping to another ring, which is the essence of what a ring isomorphism addresses.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a ring isomorphism is not necessary for the definition of a field to make sense. The definition of a field can be fully understood and applied without any reference to ring isomorphisms.",
