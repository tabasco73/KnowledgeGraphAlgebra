The definition of a ring extension explicitly states that it involves a pair (S, R), where S is a subring of R. This means that the concept of a subring is directly used in defining what a ring extension is.\\n\\n2. Without understanding what a subring is, one cannot determine whether S qualifies as a subring of R, which is crucial for identifying (S, R) as a ring extension.\\n\\n3. The definition of a subring provides the criteria that a subset S must meet to be considered a subring of R. This includes being a subgroup with respect to addition and a submonoid with respect to multiplication, both inherited from R.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a subring is foundational and necessary for the concept of a ring extension, as it specifies the properties that S must have within the larger ring R to form a ring extension.",
