            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Splitting field of a Family of Polynomials, we need to analyze the components of each definition:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Splitting field of a Family of Polynomials involves a field \\(K\\) and its extension \\(L\\). Both \\(K\\) and \\(L\\) are fields, which are special types of rings that additionally have multiplicative inverses for every non-zero element.\\n\\n2. The polynomials \\(f_i\\) are elements of \\(K[X]\\), which is the ring of polynomials over the field \\(K\\). The ring of polynomials inherits the ring structure from \\(K\\), meaning that \\(K[X]\\) is also a ring.\\n\\n3. The operations within the field \\(K\\) and the polynomial ring \\(K[X]\\) (addition and multiplication) are based on the ring properties. These operations are essential for defining the polynomial decomposition in the splitting field \\(L\\).\\n\\n4. The concept of a ring provides the foundational algebraic structure necessary for defining fields and polynomial rings. Without the concept of a ring, the algebraic operations and properties used in the definition of fields and polynomial rings would not be well-defined.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a ring is essential for the definition of a splitting field of a family of polynomials because it underpins the structure and operations of fields and polynomial rings, which are central to the definition of a splitting field.",
