                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Simple Field Extension, we need to analyze the components involved in each definition.\\n\\n1. **Simple Field Extension**: This concept involves a field extension $K \\subset L$, where $L$ is generated by adjoining an element $\\alpha$ to $K$, denoted as $L=K(\\alpha)$. The definition inherently involves fields, which are special types of rings that additionally require every non-zero element to have a multiplicative inverse.\\n\\n2. **Ring**: A ring is defined as a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, satisfying certain properties like associativity, distributivity, and the existence of a unit element for multiplication.\\n\\n3. **Relationship between Fields and Rings**: Fields are a subset of rings with additional properties. Therefore, understanding and defining fields (as used in the definition of a Simple Field Extension) inherently requires the concept of rings. Without the foundational concept of a ring, the structure and properties of a field cannot be fully understood or defined.\\n\\nThus, the concept of a Ring is necessary to properly define and understand a Field, which in turn is crucial for defining a Simple Field Extension.",
