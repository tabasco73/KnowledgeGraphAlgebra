                "Explanation": "The definition of a symmetric group involves the concept of bijective self-maps of a set, specifically the set \\n{1, ..., n}. This definition focuses on permutations of elements within a single set and the operations (such as composition of functions) that can be performed on these permutations.\\n\\nThe Cartesian product, on the other hand, involves creating ordered pairs from elements of a set or between different sets. It is used to define structures like binary relations or functions from one set to another, but it is not directly involved in defining the operations or elements of a symmetric group.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding or defining a symmetric group does not require the concept of the Cartesian product. The symmetric group's definition and structure are self-contained with respect to the operations on the set {1, ..., n} and do not rely on the concept of forming ordered pairs or tuples from the set, which is what the Cartesian product would entail.",
