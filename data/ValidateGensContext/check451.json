                "Explanation": "The concept of the minimal polynomial is defined as the unique monic polynomial of the smallest degree in the base field that has a specific element as a root. This definition inherently involves the concept of polynomial degree but does not explicitly require the concept of the degree of the field extension. The degree of the field extension, defined as the dimension of one field as a vector space over another, is a separate concept that quantifies the 'size' or 'complexity' of the extension but is not necessary to define or understand what a minimal polynomial is. The minimal polynomial's definition is focused on polynomial properties and its relationship to a specific element in the extension, independent of the overall structure or dimension of the field extension itself.",
