The definition of the characteristic of a field involves the concepts of fields, ring homomorphisms, and ideals (specifically principal ideals and their generators). The definition specifically uses the canonical ring homomorphism from the integers \\\\(\\textbackslash{}mathbb{Z}\\\\) to the field \\\\(\\textbackslash{}K\\\\), and the kernel of this homomorphism, which is an ideal in \\\\(\\textbackslash{}mathbb{Z}\\\\). While an ideal is indeed a subset of the ring (in this case, \\\\(\\textbackslash{}mathbb{Z}\\\\)), the concept of a subset itself is not explicitly needed to understand or define the characteristic of a field. The understanding of ideals and their properties (including being subsets) is more directly relevant, but the basic concept of a subset does not need to be defined separately for the characteristic of a field to make sense.",
