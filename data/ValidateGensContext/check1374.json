                "Explanation": "The definition of a cyclic group explicitly mentions the concept of a group homomorphism. It states that a group $G$ is cyclic if there exists a surjective group homomorphism from $\\\\$\\mathbb{Z}\\\\$ to $G$. This implies that understanding what a group homomorphism is, specifically how it functions and its properties, is essential to fully grasp the definition of a cyclic group. Without the concept of a group homomorphism, the part of the definition that involves the mapping from $\\\\$\\mathbb{Z}\\\\$ to $G$ would not make sense, as it relies on the properties of homomorphisms (such as preserving the group operation). Therefore, the concept of a group homomorphism is necessary for the definition of a cyclic group to be complete and understandable.",
