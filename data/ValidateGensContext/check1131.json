                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial is necessary for defining a Splitting Field of the polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield, we need to analyze the relationship between these two concepts.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial states that it is a field extension $L/K$ where a polynomial $f$ splits into linear factors. This definition is general and applies to any polynomial $f$ and any field $K$.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Splitting Field of the polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield is a specific instance of the general concept. It specifies the polynomial $X^q-X$ and the prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$ as the base field $K$. The requirement that $X^q-X$ splits into linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}$ aligns with the general definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial.\\n\\n3. Therefore, the concept of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial provides the foundational framework necessary to define the Splitting Field of the polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield. Without the general concept, the specific case would lack a formal basis and context within the broader theory of field extensions and polynomial factorization.",
