                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring Extension is necessary for the definition of a Finite Ring Homomorphism, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Finite Ring Homomorphism states that a ring homomorphism \\(\\varphi: A \\longrightarrow B\\) is finite if \\(B\\) is a finite \\(A\\)-module under \\(\\varphi\\). It also mentions that if \\(\\varphi\\) is an inclusion homomorphism, the extension \\(A \\hookrightarrow B\\) is finite.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Ring Extension is that the pair (S, R), where S is a subring of R, is called a ring extension.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Ring Extension is directly referenced in the definition of a Finite Ring Homomorphism when discussing inclusion homomorphisms. The term 'extension' in the context of ring theory specifically refers to a situation where one ring is a subring of another, which aligns with the definition of a Ring Extension.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Ring Extension is indeed necessary for the definition of a Finite Ring Homomorphism, especially when considering inclusion homomorphisms where one ring is a subring of another, making the extension finite.",
