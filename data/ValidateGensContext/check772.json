                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring Automorphism is necessary for defining the Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Field, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Field is defined as the group of automorphisms of the splitting field of the polynomial that fix the base field. These automorphisms permute the roots of the polynomial.\\n\\n2. A Ring Automorphism is defined as an isomorphism from a ring $R$ to itself.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, we see that the Galois Group involves automorphisms of a field (which is a special type of ring), specifically those that fix the base field and permute the roots of the polynomial. Since a field is a ring with additional properties (like multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements), any automorphism of a field is also a ring automorphism. Therefore, understanding ring automorphisms provides a foundational concept necessary to grasp field automorphisms, which are central to the definition of the Galois Group.\\n\\nThus, the concept of a Ring Automorphism is indeed necessary to fully understand and define the Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Field, as it underpins the understanding of automorphisms in the more specific context of fields.",
