                "Explanation": "The concept of a Product of Ideals involves the multiplication of elements from two ideals within a ring to form a new ideal. This definition requires only the structure of a ring, specifically the ability to add and multiply elements according to the ring's operations. The definition does not specify any requirements about the invertibility of every element, which is a key characteristic of a division ring.\\n\\nA Division Ring, by definition, is a ring where every nonzero element is a unit, meaning every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. This property is not necessary for the definition or operation of the product of ideals. The product of ideals can be defined and understood entirely within the context of general ring theory, without the need for every element to be invertible.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a division ring is not necessary for the definition of the product of ideals to make sense. The product of ideals relies on the basic ring operations of addition and multiplication, and does not require the additional structure of a division ring where every element is invertible.",
