                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial, we need to analyze the components and requirements of each concept.\\n\\n1. **Splitting Field of a Polynomial**: This concept involves a field $K$ and a field extension $L$ such that a polynomial $f$ with coefficients in $K$ splits into linear factors in $L$. The definition inherently requires the operations of addition and multiplication within the fields $K$ and $L$, as these are fundamental to the structure of a field and the behavior of polynomials.\\n\\n2. **Law of Composition**: This concept describes a general operation on a set, mapping pairs of elements to another element within the same set. In the context of fields, the operations of addition and multiplication are specific instances of laws of composition, as they map pairs of field elements to another field element.\\n\\nGiven that the definition of a field (and thus the operations within a field like $K$ or $L$) inherently includes laws of composition (addition and multiplication), the concept of a Law of Composition is indeed necessary for the operations within a field. Since the definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial relies on these field operations to discuss how a polynomial splits into linear factors, the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for making sense of the definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial.",
