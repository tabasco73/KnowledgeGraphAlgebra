                "Explanation": "The definition of a Normalizer explicitly requires the concept of a Subset. In the given definition of Normalizer, it states that 'Let $G$ be a group and $S \\subset G$ a subset.' This indicates that $S$ must be a subset of $G$ for the normalizer $N_{S}$ to be defined. The normalizer $N_{S}$ is the set of all elements in $G$ that commute with every element of the subset $S$ in a specific manner ($xS = Sx$). Without the concept of a Subset, we cannot define what $S$ is in relation to $G$, and thus the definition of a Normalizer would not make sense. Therefore, the concept of a Subset is necessary for the definition of a Normalizer.",
