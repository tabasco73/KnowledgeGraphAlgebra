                "Explanation": "The concept of a ring isomorphism involves a bijective ring homomorphism between two rings, R and R', where each ring is considered in its entirety. The definition of a ring isomorphism does not require the consideration of any subsets of these rings, such as subrings. It solely focuses on the properties and operations of the rings as whole entities.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a subring pertains to a subset of a ring that itself forms a ring under the same operations as the parent ring. While subrings are important in the study of ring theory, they are not directly relevant to the definition or understanding of a ring isomorphism. A ring isomorphism is concerned with a correspondence between two entire rings, not parts or subsets of them.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a subring is not necessary for the definition of a ring isomorphism to make sense. The definition and understanding of ring isomorphisms can be fully grasped without reference to subrings.",
