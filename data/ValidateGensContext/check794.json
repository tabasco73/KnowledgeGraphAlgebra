                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of a 'Solvable group' to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a solvable group:\\n\\n1. A group $G$ is defined as a set with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses).\\n2. The definition of a solvable group involves a chain of subgroups $G_{0} \\supsetneq G_{1} \\supsetneq \\ldots \\supsetneq G_{r}=\\{1\\}$. Each of these subgroups $G_i$ is itself a set.\\n3. The concept of a normal subgroup and the residue class group $G_{i} / G_{i+1}$ being abelian also inherently involve understanding sets and their elements. For example, a normal subgroup $G_{i+1}$ of $G_i$ means that for every element $g$ in $G_i$ and every element $h$ in $G_{i+1}$, the element $ghg^{-1}$ is also in $G_{i+1}$.\\n4. The residue class group $G_{i} / G_{i+1}$ is formed by the cosets of $G_{i+1}$ in $G_i$, which are sets containing elements of the form $gG_{i+1}$ where $g$ is an element of $G_i$.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is fundamental to understanding groups, subgroups, normal subgroups, and residue class groups, all of which are essential in the definition of a solvable group. Without the concept of elements of a set, the structure and relationships described in the definition of a solvable group cannot be properly understood or defined.",
