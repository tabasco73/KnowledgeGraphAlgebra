                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for defining an 'Integral Ring Homomorphism', we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of an 'Integral Ring Homomorphism' states that it is a ring homomorphism \\\\(\\varphi: A \\longrightarrow B\\\\) where every element \\\\(b \\\\in B\\\\) is integral over \\\\(A\\\\). This definition inherently uses the concept of elements of a set, specifically the elements of the set \\\\(B\\\\).\\n\\n2. The concept of an 'Element of a Set' is defined as an object belonging to a set. This is a fundamental concept in set theory and is crucial for discussing properties or characteristics of any set, including the set \\\\(B\\\\) in the context of ring homomorphisms.\\n\\n3. Without understanding what it means for an object to be an element of a set, the statement that 'every element \\\\(b \\\\in B\\\\) is integral over \\\\(A\\\\)' in the definition of an integral ring homomorphism would not make sense. The relationship \\\\(b \\\\in B\\\\) indicates that \\\\(b\\\\) is an element of the set \\\\(B\\\\), and this relationship is fundamental to applying the concept of integrality.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is indeed necessary to make sense of the definition of an 'Integral Ring Homomorphism'. Without this concept, we cannot properly define or understand the relationship and properties described in the definition of an integral ring homomorphism.",
