                "Explanation": "The concept of a torsion submodule involves identifying elements within an A-module M that satisfy certain properties (being torsion elements). This concept is independent of whether the module M is finitely generated or not. A torsion submodule can be defined for any A-module, regardless of whether it has a finite number of generators or an infinite number. The definition of a torsion submodule does not reference or require the module to be finitely generated; it solely focuses on the properties of the elements within the module.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a finitely generated module pertains to the existence of a finite set of generators that can generate the entire module. This concept is about the structure and construction of the module, rather than the properties of individual elements within it.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a torsion submodule do not depend on the module being finitely generated. The two concepts operate independently in the context of module theory in algebra.",
