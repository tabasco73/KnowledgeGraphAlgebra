(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of the Image of a Ring Homomorphism to make sense, we need to analyze the components involved in the definition of the Image of a Ring Homomorphism. The definition states that given a ring homomorphism \\n$\\nvarphi: R \\nlongrightarrow R'$\\n, the image of \\n$\\nvarphi$\\n, denoted \\n$\\noperatorname{im} \\nvarphi$\\n, is defined as \\n$\\nvarphi(R)$\\n, which is a subring of \\n$\\nR'$\\n. This definition inherently involves two rings, \\n$\\nR$\\n and \\n$\\nR'$\\n, and the concept of a ring homomorphism, which is a function between two rings that preserves the ring operations.\\n\\nThe concept of a Ring is fundamental here because without understanding what a ring is, one cannot comprehend what it means for \\n$\\nR$\\n and \\n$\\nR'$\\n to be rings, nor can one grasp the significance of the operations being preserved by the homomorphism. Furthermore, the definition of the image as a subring of \\n$\\nR'$\\n also requires understanding what a subring is, which again depends on the definition of a ring. Therefore, the concept of a Ring is essential for defining and understanding the Image of a Ring Homomorphism.",
