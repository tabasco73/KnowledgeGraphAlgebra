                "Explanation": "The concept of a Stabilizer is defined within the context of a group action, where a group $G$ acts on a set $X$. The stabilizer of a point $x$ in $X$, denoted $G_x$, is the set of all elements in $G$ that leave $x$ invariant under the group action. This definition requires the concepts of groups and group actions but does not specifically require the concept of a Symmetric Group.\\n\\nThe Symmetric Group $\\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\)$ is a specific type of group, representing all the permutations of a finite set of $n$ elements. While the Symmetric Group itself is an example of a group that can act on a set (and thus have stabilizers for elements of that set), the general concept of a stabilizer does not depend on the concept of the Symmetric Group. Stabilizers can be defined for any group action, not just those involving symmetric groups.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a stabilizer does not inherently require the definition of a Symmetric Group. The concept of a stabilizer is broader and applies to any group action, irrespective of whether the group is symmetric or not.",
