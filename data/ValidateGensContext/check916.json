            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of the concept of Localization of a Ring explicitly requires the existence of a ring $R$. The localization process involves creating a new ring from $R$, specifically by forming fractions of elements from $R$ with denominators from a multiplicative subset $S$ of $R$. Without the initial concept of a ring, the elements $a$ and $s$ mentioned in the definition of localization would not have a defined algebraic structure or context. Therefore, the concept of a ring is fundamental and necessary for the concept of localization of a ring to be meaningful and applicable.",
