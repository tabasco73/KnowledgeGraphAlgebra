                "Explanation": "The definition of the product of ideals involves the set of all finite sums of products of elements from two ideals, \\n$\\frak{a}$ and $\\frak{b}$, in a ring $R$. This definition does not inherently require the ring $R$ to be commutative, meaning that it does not require $ab = ba$ for all $a, b \\n\\text{in } R$. The product of ideals is well-defined even in non-commutative rings, where the commutative law may not hold. Therefore, the concept of the commutative law is not necessary for the definition of the product of ideals to make sense. The product of ideals can be defined and understood without assuming that the multiplication in the ring is commutative.",
