                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a commutative ring is necessary for the definition of trivial ideals, we need to analyze the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of trivial ideals states that in any ring $R$, the zero ideal $\\\\(\\{0\\}\\)$ and the unit ideal $R$ are called trivial ideals. This definition applies to any ring, regardless of whether the ring is commutative or not.\\n\\n2. The definition of a commutative ring specifies that a ring $R$ is commutative if the multiplication within the ring is commutative. This property of multiplication does not influence the existence or definition of the zero ideal or the unit ideal.\\n\\n3. The definition of trivial ideals does not specify that the ring must be commutative. It only requires the structure of a ring, which includes elements and the operations of addition and multiplication, but does not require commutativity of multiplication.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of trivial ideals can be applied to any ring, whether it is commutative or not. The existence and definition of trivial ideals are independent of the commutativity of the ring.",
