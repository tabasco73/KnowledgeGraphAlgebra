            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of a Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field, we need to analyze the relationship between these two concepts. The definition of a Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field describes it as a group formed by all nonzero elements of a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, denoted as $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$. This definition inherently relies on the properties of a group, as it specifies that $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$ is cyclic and of order $q-1$. \\n\\nThe concept of a Group, as defined, provides the foundational structure needed to understand what it means for $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$ to be a group. It specifies the requirements of associativity, the existence of a unit element, and the existence of inverses for each element. These are essential properties that define how the elements of $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$ interact under multiplication, which is the operation of the group in this context. \\n\\nWithout the concept of a Group, the definition of a Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field would lack the necessary framework to describe its structure and properties, such as the existence of inverses and the associative nature of its operation. Therefore, the concept of a Group is indeed necessary to fully understand and define what a Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field is.",
