                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Ring Homomorphism of Finite Type, we need to analyze the components involved in each definition.\\n\\n1. **Ring Homomorphism of Finite Type**: This concept involves a ring homomorphism between two rings, A and B, and extends to polynomial rings over A. Rings, by definition, include operations of addition and multiplication, which are laws of composition. These operations are essential for defining the structure of the ring and for the operations within the polynomial ring.\\n\\n2. **Law of Composition**: This concept defines a general operation on a set, mapping pairs of elements to another element in the same set. In the context of rings, the operations of addition and multiplication are specific instances of laws of composition.\\n\\nGiven that the definition of a ring (and thus a ring homomorphism) inherently includes laws of composition (addition and multiplication), it is clear that the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Ring Homomorphism of Finite Type. Without laws of composition, the algebraic structures of the rings and the polynomial rings involved in the definition of a ring homomorphism of finite type would not be properly defined.",
