This implies that the concept of a Euclidean domain is fundamental to the definition of a Euclidean function, as the function itself is defined within the context of a Euclidean domain. Without the concept of a Euclidean domain, the Euclidean function would lack the necessary framework in which it operates, making the concept of a Euclidean domain essential for the definition of a Euclidean function to make sense.",
