                "Explanation": "To understand the definition of the Galois group of a finite field extension, we need to comprehend the concept of field automorphisms that fix a certain field, specifically $\\mathbb{F}_q$ in this case. The definition states that the Galois group consists of automorphisms of $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ that fix every element of $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This implies that $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be a subset of $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ for the automorphisms to have elements to fix. Therefore, understanding what it means for one set (or field, in this context) to be a subset of another is crucial to understanding the definition of the Galois group. Without the concept of a subset, the notion of fixing $\\mathbb{F}_q$ within $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ would not be meaningful, as it inherently relies on the idea that all elements of $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are contained within $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$. Thus, the concept of a subset is necessary for the definition of the Galois group of a finite field extension to make sense.",
