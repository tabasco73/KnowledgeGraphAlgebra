                "Explanation": "The definition of a Group Action involves a map from the Cartesian product of a group $G$ and a set $X$ to the set $X$. Specifically, the map is defined as $G \\times X \\longrightarrow X$. This implies that the concept of the Cartesian product is inherently used in defining the function that represents the group action. Without the concept of the Cartesian product, it would not be possible to define the domain of the function that maps pairs $(g, x)$, where $g \\in G$ and $x \\in X$, to elements in $X$. Therefore, the concept of a Cartesian product is necessary for the definition of a group action to make sense, as it provides the framework for combining elements of $G$ and $X$ into ordered pairs, which are then used in the mapping process.",
