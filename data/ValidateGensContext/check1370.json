                "Explanation": "The definition of a Factor Group explicitly requires the existence of a normal subgroup $N$ of a group $G$. The factor group $G / N$ is defined as the group formed by the set of left cosets of $N$ in $G$. The group operation within the factor group is defined based on these cosets, specifically $(aN) \\times (bN) = (ab)N$. This operation is well-defined only because $N$ is a normal subgroup, ensuring that the product of any two cosets is also a coset. If $N$ were not normal, the product of two cosets might not be a coset, breaking the group structure. Therefore, the concept of a normal subgroup is essential for the definition of a factor group to make sense, as it guarantees the closure and well-definedness of the group operation in the factor group.",
