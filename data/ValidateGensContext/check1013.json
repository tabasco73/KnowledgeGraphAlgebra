            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of an A-module, we need to analyze the components of the A-module definition. An A-module is defined as an abelian group M, which means M itself must satisfy the properties of a group, specifically an abelian group where the operation is commutative. This directly implies that the concept of a group is fundamental since an abelian group is a special type of group. Furthermore, the definition of an A-module includes operations that involve elements behaving under group-like operations (associativity, identity, and inverses) and additional structure provided by the exterior multiplication which adheres to axioms similar to those in vector spaces. Therefore, understanding and defining a group is essential before one can fully grasp or define what an A-module is, as the foundational concept of a group (and specifically an abelian group) is integral to the structure and properties of an A-module.",
