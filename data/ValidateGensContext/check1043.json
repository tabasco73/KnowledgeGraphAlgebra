                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Field needs to be defined for the definition of an Algebraic Field Extension to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies between these concepts.\\n\\n1. The definition of an Algebraic Field Extension involves the concept of an extension field $L$ being algebraic over another field $K$. This implies that both $L$ and $K$ are fields.\\n\\n2. The definition of a field, as given, is a commutative division ring. This definition establishes the fundamental properties of a field, including the operations of addition and multiplication, the existence of additive and multiplicative identities, and inverses.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a field, the terms used in the definition of an Algebraic Field Extension such as 'field $K$', 'extension field $L$', and the property of being 'algebraic over $K$' would lack the necessary context. These terms rely on the understanding that $K$ and $L$ possess the structure and properties of a field.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a Field is essential to provide the foundational properties and operations that define what it means for $L$ to be an extension of $K$ and for elements of $L$ to be algebraic over $K$.",
