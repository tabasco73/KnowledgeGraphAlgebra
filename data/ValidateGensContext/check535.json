                "Explanation": "The concept of a right coset involves a group $G$ and a subgroup $H$. A right coset of $H$ in $G$ is defined as a subset formed by multiplying each element of $H$ by a fixed element $a$ from $G$. This definition inherently relies on the properties of a group, specifically the ability to multiply elements and the existence of an identity element in the group.\\n\\nA monoid, on the other hand, is a set with an associative binary operation and a unit element. While a group is a special type of monoid (since it includes all the properties of a monoid plus the requirement for every element to have an inverse), the definition of a right coset does not specifically require the concept of a monoid. It directly requires the concept of a group.\\n\\nTherefore, while a group (used in the definition of a right coset) is a type of monoid, the specific concept of a monoid is not necessary to define a right coset. The essential requirement is the group structure, not just any monoid structure.",
