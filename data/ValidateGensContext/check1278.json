                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Extension involves a pair (S, R) where S is a subring of R. This definition requires understanding the relationship between two rings, specifically that one is a subring of the other. It does not inherently require the concept of Cartesian products, which involves creating a set of ordered pairs from a single set. The Cartesian product is a fundamental concept in set theory used in various mathematical contexts, but it is not specifically required to define or understand a ring extension. The definition of a ring extension focuses on the inclusion relationship between two algebraic structures (rings), not on the product of sets or elements within a single set.",
