            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of a Cycle to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Cycle involves a permutation \\\\(\\pi \\\\in \\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\), which is a specific type of function from a set to itself that rearranges elements. The set of all such permutations forms a group under the operation of composition, known as the symmetric group \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\).\\n\\n2. The properties of permutations, including being a cycle, inherently rely on the group structure of \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\). This group structure provides the framework for understanding how permutations can be composed and inverted, which are essential aspects of their behavior and classification (including cycles).\\n\\n3. The definition of a Group provides the necessary background to understand what it means for \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\) to be a group. It explains the concepts of associative law, identity element, and inverses, all of which are crucial for handling permutations like cycles.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of a Group, the understanding of permutations as cycles would lack the mathematical foundation required to discuss their properties and operations within \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Group is necessary to fully understand and define what a Cycle is in the context of permutations.",
