                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a subset is necessary for the definition of an alternating group, we need to analyze the components of the definition of an alternating group. The definition of an alternating group involves the set of all even permutations of a set $\\\\[1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\]$, which is a subset of the symmetric group $\\\\[\\\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\]$. The symmetric group $\\\\[\\\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\]$ itself consists of all permutations of the set $\\\\[1, \\\\ldots, n\\\\]$. \\n\\nThe alternating group is specifically defined as a subset of $\\\\[\\\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\]$ that includes only even permutations, which are those permutations with a sign of 1. This directly uses the concept of a subset, as the alternating group is a collection of elements (even permutations) all of which are contained within another set (the symmetric group). Therefore, understanding what a subset is becomes crucial to understanding the structure and definition of an alternating group. Without the concept of a subset, the notion of selecting only even permutations from the symmetric group to form the alternating group would not be clearly understandable.",
