                "Explanation": "To understand the concept of a splitting field of a polynomial, it is essential to first grasp what a polynomial is and how it is defined. A polynomial is generally expressed as a sum of terms, each consisting of a coefficient multiplied by a variable raised to a power. The coefficients are fundamental to the structure of the polynomial, as they determine the specific values that the polynomial takes for different inputs.\\n\\nIn the definition of a splitting field, it is stated that the field $L$ is an extension of $K$ where the polynomial $f$, which has coefficients in $K$, splits into linear factors. This implies that the coefficients of the polynomial are elements of the field $K$, and these coefficients are crucial in determining how the polynomial behaves over the field, including how it can be factored or split.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding and defining the coefficients of a polynomial are necessary to fully comprehend how a polynomial is constructed and how it behaves within a field, which is directly relevant to understanding what a splitting field is and how it functions relative to the polynomial and its coefficients.",
