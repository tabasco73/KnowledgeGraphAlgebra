                "Explanation": "The concept of the order of an element is specific to group theory, where it refers to the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $a^m = 1$ for an element $a$ in a group $G$. This definition is self-contained within the context of group theory and does not require the concept of a domain as defined in the context of functions. The domain in the context of functions pertains to the set of all possible inputs for which a function is defined, which is unrelated to the concept of the order of an element in a group. Therefore, understanding or defining the order of an element does not depend on the concept of a domain as it applies to functions.",
