                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the Image of a Map is necessary for the definition of a Ring Isomorphism, we need to analyze the requirements of a Ring Isomorphism. According to the provided definition, a ring isomorphism is a bijective ring homomorphism, meaning it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). The surjectivity of a function implies that every element in the codomain has a pre-image in the domain, which is essentially the definition of the image covering the entire codomain. Thus, understanding that a ring isomorphism is surjective inherently involves understanding that the image of the map is the entire codomain. However, the explicit concept of the 'Image of a Map' as defined (the set of all elements in B that have at least one pre-image in A) is not directly referenced in the definition of a ring isomorphism, but it is implicitly understood through the requirement of surjectivity. Therefore, while the concept of the image of a map helps in understanding the full implications of surjectivity, it is not strictly necessary to define a ring isomorphism, as the key requirement is the bijectiveness (both injectivity and surjectivity) of the function.",
