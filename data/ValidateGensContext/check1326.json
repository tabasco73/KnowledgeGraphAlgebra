                "Explanation": "The definition of an Algebra over a Ring explicitly includes the concept of a ring homomorphism. According to the provided definition, an algebra $B$ over a ring $A$ is defined as a ring homomorphism from $A$ to $B$. Additionally, a homomorphism between two $A$-algebras $B$ and $C$ is also described as a ring homomorphism from $B$ to $C$ that is compatible with the ring homomorphisms from $A$ to $B$ and $A$ to $C$. This indicates that the concept of a ring homomorphism is integral to the definition of an algebra over a ring, as it is used to define the structure and the relationships between the rings involved. Without understanding what a ring homomorphism is, one cannot fully comprehend or define an algebra over a ring, since the concept of homomorphism underlies the structural connections made in the definition of an algebra over a ring.",
