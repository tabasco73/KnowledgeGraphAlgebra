This definition is independent of the properties of the ring itself, such as whether it is Noetherian or not. The definition of an Ideal corresponding to a subset does not require any conditions on the ring's structure regarding ascending chains of ideals or the finite generation of ideals.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Noetherian ring pertains to the behavior of chains of ideals within the ring and whether every ideal is finitely generated. This property of a ring being Noetherian is significant in many areas of algebra, but it is not a prerequisite for the definition or understanding of an Ideal corresponding to a subset. The definition of the Ideal corresponding to a subset can be applied to any polynomial ring, regardless of whether it is Noetherian or not.",
