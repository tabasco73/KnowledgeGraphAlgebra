                "Explanation": "The concept of a Dedekind domain focuses on the properties of ideals within an integral domain, specifically the unique factorization of ideals into prime ideals. This definition inherently relies on the structure of the integral domain itself and its ideals, but does not explicitly require the field of fractions of the domain.\\n\\nThe field of fractions, on the other hand, is a construction that extends an integral domain to a field by including inverses for all non-zero elements. While the field of fractions is a useful concept for many areas of algebra, it is not directly necessary for defining or understanding a Dedekind domain. The properties and theorems related to Dedekind domains can be discussed and proved without reference to the field of fractions.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a field of fractions is not needed for the definition of a Dedekind domain to make sense. The definition and properties of Dedekind domains are self-contained with respect to the behavior of ideals within the integral domain itself.",
