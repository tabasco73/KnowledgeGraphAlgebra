                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Algebraic Element is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic Field Extension, we need to analyze the relationship between these two concepts based on their definitions.\\n\\n1. The definition of an Algebraic Field Extension states that an extension field $L$ is algebraic over $K$ if every element $\\alpha \\in L$ is algebraic over $K$.\\n2. The definition of an Algebraic Element specifies that an element $\\alpha \\in L$ is algebraic over $K$ if it satisfies a specific type of polynomial equation with coefficients in $K$.\\n3. Thus, the definition of an Algebraic Field Extension inherently relies on the concept of an element being algebraic over $K$, which is precisely defined by the concept of an Algebraic Element.\\n4. Without the concept of an Algebraic Element, we would not have a criterion to determine whether each element $\\alpha \\in L$ meets the condition required for $L$ to be an Algebraic Field Extension of $K$.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an Algebraic Element is essential for the definition of an Algebraic Field Extension to be meaningful and complete.",
