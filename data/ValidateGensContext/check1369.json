                "Explanation": "The definition of a normal subgroup explicitly relies on the concept of right cosets. According to the definition, a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is normal if $aH = Ha$ for all $a \\\\$in G$. This equality involves both left and right cosets of $H$ in $G$. The left coset $aH$ and the right coset $Ha$ must be equal for all elements $a$ in $G$ for $H$ to be considered normal. Therefore, understanding what a right coset is becomes essential to understanding what it means for a subgroup to be normal. Without the concept of right cosets, the condition $aH = Ha$ would not make sense, as we wouldn't have a clear definition of what $Ha$ represents. Thus, the concept of a right coset is necessary for the definition of a normal subgroup to be complete and understandable.",
