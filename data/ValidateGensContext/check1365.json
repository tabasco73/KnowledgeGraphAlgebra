                "Explanation": "The definitions provided for both a Group Homomorphism and a Monoid Homomorphism are essentially the same, with the only distinction being that in the context of a Group Homomorphism, both $G$ and $G^{\\prime}$ are specifically groups, not just monoids. A group is a special type of monoid where every element has an inverse. The definition of a Group Homomorphism includes all the properties of a Monoid Homomorphism (preservation of the unit element and the operation), and then specifies that this applies in the context of groups. Therefore, the concept of a Monoid Homomorphism is inherently included within the definition of a Group Homomorphism. Understanding Monoid Homomorphisms is necessary to grasp the concept of Group Homomorphisms because it lays the foundational properties that are extended to groups. Thus, the concept of a Monoid Homomorphism is needed for the definition of a Group Homomorphism to make sense.",
