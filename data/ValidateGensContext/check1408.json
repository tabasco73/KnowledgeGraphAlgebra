                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a 'System of generators' is necessary for the definition of a 'Finitely generated module' to make sense, we need to analyze the relationship between these two concepts based on their definitions.\\n\\n1. The definition of a 'Finitely generated module' states that an A-module M is finitely generated if it admits a finite system of generators. This implies that the concept of a 'System of generators' is inherently used in defining what it means for a module to be finitely generated.\\n\\n2. The definition of a 'System of generators' describes it as a family of elements of an A-module M such that the entire module M can be expressed as the sum of the submodules generated by these elements. This definition provides the framework for understanding how elements can generate a module.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a 'System of generators', the definition of a 'Finitely generated module' would lack the necessary detail on how the module is generated by its elements. The term 'finite system of generators' in the definition of a finitely generated module directly refers to the concept of a 'System of generators'.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a 'System of generators' is essential for the definition of a 'Finitely generated module' because it specifies the mechanism through which a module can be considered finitely generated.",
