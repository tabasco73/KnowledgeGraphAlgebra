A Ring Endomorphism is defined as a homomorphism from a ring $R$ to itself, $\\\\[\\varphi: R \\longrightarrow R\\\\r]. This definition requires the concept of a ring and the concept of a homomorphism, but it does not specify that the ring $R$ must be commutative.\\n\\n2. A Commutative Ring is defined as a ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. This is a specific type of ring, but not all rings are commutative.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the definition of a Ring Endomorphism does not depend on the ring being commutative. The concept of a Ring Endomorphism applies to any ring, whether it is commutative or not. Therefore, the concept of a Commutative Ring is not necessary for the definition of a Ring Endomorphism to make sense.",
