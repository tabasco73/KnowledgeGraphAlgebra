                "Explanation": "The definition of the order of an element explicitly states that it is the order of the cyclic group generated by that element in a group G. This implies that the concept of a cyclic group is integral to understanding and defining the order of an element. Without the concept of a cyclic group, one cannot define what it means for an element to generate a group or determine the smallest positive integer m such that a^m = 1, as these ideas rely on the structure and properties of cyclic groups. Therefore, the concept of a cyclic group is necessary for the definition of the order of an element to be meaningful and complete.",
