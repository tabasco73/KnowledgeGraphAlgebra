                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a submodule is necessary for defining a finite ring homomorphism, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. Finite Ring Homomorphism: This is defined as a ring homomorphism \\n$\\nvarphi: A \\nlongrightarrow B\\n$ where $B$ is a finite $A$-module under $\\nvarphi\\n$. The definition specifically involves the concept of $B$ being a module over $A$, and the finiteness of this module.\\n\\n2. Submodule: This concept defines a submodule $N$ of an $A$-module $M$ as a subset that is closed under the operations of $M$. This definition is crucial for understanding the structure and properties of modules, including their substructures.\\n\\nIn the definition of a finite ring homomorphism, the focus is on $B$ being a finite $A$-module. The concept of a submodule, while related to modules, is not directly invoked or required to understand or define a finite ring homomorphism. The definition of a finite ring homomorphism does not inherently require the understanding of submodules, but rather the concept of a module and its finiteness. Therefore, the concept of a submodule is not necessary for the definition of a finite ring homomorphism to make sense.",
