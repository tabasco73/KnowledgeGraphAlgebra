                "Explanation": "The definition of an algebraic subset involves the set of common zeros of a collection of polynomials from a polynomial ring over a field. This definition requires understanding what a polynomial is and how to evaluate it at points in a given space, but it does not inherently require the concept of irreducibility. Irreducibility of a polynomial pertains to the factorization properties of the polynomial itself within its ring, which is a separate issue from the evaluation of polynomials at points to determine zeros. Thus, while the concept of irreducible polynomials is important in many areas of algebra, particularly in the study of polynomial factorization and field extensions, it is not necessary for the basic definition or understanding of what constitutes an algebraic subset. An algebraic subset can be defined and understood merely with the concept of polynomials and their zeros, without any reference to whether these polynomials are irreducible or not.",
