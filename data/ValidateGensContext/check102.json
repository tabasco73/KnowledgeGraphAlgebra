This definition focuses solely on the elements within each cycle and their relationships to each other, specifically whether they share any elements or not.\\n\\nThe concept of a codomain, on the other hand, pertains to functions and describes the set of all possible outputs a function can have, regardless of whether all these outputs are achieved by the function from its domain. This concept is related to the mapping of elements from one set to another but does not directly influence the definition or understanding of disjoint cycles.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding or defining disjoint cycles does not require the concept of a codomain. Disjoint cycles can be fully understood and defined using only the notion of sets and elements within those sets, without any reference to functions or their codomains.",
