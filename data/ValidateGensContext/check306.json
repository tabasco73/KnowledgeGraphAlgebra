                "Explanation": "The definition of a Commutative Ring states that a ring R is commutative if the multiplication within the ring is commutative. This directly implies that for all elements a, b in the ring R, the product ab equals ba. This is exactly the definition of the Commutative Law, which states that a law of composition on a set M is commutative if ab = ba for all elements a, b in M. Therefore, the concept of the Commutative Law must be understood or defined in order to grasp what it means for a ring to be commutative. Without the concept of the Commutative Law, the definition of a Commutative Ring would lack clarity and completeness, as the term 'commutative' in the context of ring multiplication would not be explicitly defined.",
