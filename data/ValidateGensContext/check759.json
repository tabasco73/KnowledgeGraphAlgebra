                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the Image of a Map is necessary for the definition of a Cyclic group, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a Cyclic group. The definition states that a group $G$ is cyclic if there exists a surjective group homomorphism from $\\\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\\\) to $G$. A surjective homomorphism is a type of function where every element of the target set (in this case, $G$) is mapped from at least one element of the domain set (in this case, $\\\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\\\)$). The concept of surjectivity inherently involves the image of the function, as it requires that the image of the function equals the entire target set. Therefore, understanding the image of a map is crucial to understanding what it means for a homomorphism to be surjective. Without the concept of the image of a map, the notion of surjectivity, and thus the definition of a cyclic group as given, would not be fully understandable.",
