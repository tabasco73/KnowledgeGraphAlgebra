                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Map/Function is necessary for the definition of a Transposition, we need to analyze the given definitions and their interdependencies.\\n\\n1. Definition of Transposition: A 2-cycle is called a transposition. This definition refers to the concept of a '2-cycle'.\\n\\n2. Understanding a 2-cycle: A 2-cycle is a concept from permutation theory in mathematics, where it represents a specific kind of permutation. A permutation can be understood as a bijective function from a set to itself. Therefore, a 2-cycle is a particular type of function or map that swaps two elements while leaving all others fixed.\\n\\n3. Definition of Map/Function: A map is a relationship between two sets that associates every element in one set (domain) to exactly one element in another set (codomain).\\n\\n4. Connection: Since a 2-cycle, which is central to the definition of a transposition, is a type of function or map, the concept of a Map/Function is inherently required to fully understand and define what a transposition is in the context of permutations.",
