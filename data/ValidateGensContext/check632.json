                "Explanation": "The concept of an Alternating Group involves the set of all even permutations of a symmetric group, which are permutations with a sign of +1. This definition primarily relies on the properties of permutations and their signs, and does not inherently require the concept of product notation in monoids. The product notation in monoids is a general concept used to denote the multiplication of elements in a monoid, which is associative. While permutations can be composed and thus form a monoid under composition, the specific definition of an alternating group does not depend on the general concept of product notation in monoids but rather on the properties of permutations and their signs. Therefore, understanding or defining an alternating group does not necessitate the concept of product notation in monoids.",
