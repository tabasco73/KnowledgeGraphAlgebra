The definition of a torsion submodule refers to 'an A-module M' and discusses the torsion elements within this module. This implies that the concept of torsion elements and thus the torsion submodule is directly related to the structure of an A-module.\\n\\n2. A torsion element in an A-module M is typically defined based on the action of the ring A on the module M. For an element x in M to be a torsion element, there must exist a nonzero element a in A such that a.x = 0. This definition relies on the existence of the operation A x M -> M, which is part of the definition of an A-module.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of an A-module, the operation A x M -> M would not be defined, and hence, it would be impossible to discuss elements x in M for which a.x = 0 for some a in A. Therefore, the concept of torsion elements and the torsion submodule would not make sense without the underlying structure of an A-module.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of an A-module is necessary for the definition of a torsion submodule to make sense.",
