                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Extension involves a subring S being part of a larger ring R, indicating a relationship where one ring contains another as a subset. On the other hand, the concept of Localization of a Ring involves creating a new ring from an existing ring R and a multiplicative system S within R, by forming fractions that behave under certain equivalence relations. The definition of Localization does not inherently require that the resulting ring $S^{-1}R$ be a subring or an extension of R; rather, it is a construction that uses elements of R and S to form a potentially different ring structure. Therefore, understanding or defining a Ring Extension is not necessary for the definition or understanding of Localization of a Ring, as the two concepts deal with different aspects of ring theory and their definitions are independent of each other.",
