This definition focuses on the properties of subgroups and normality within a group, and the nature of quotient groups.\\n\\nThe Cartesian product, on the other hand, is a concept from set theory that defines the set of all ordered pairs from a given set. It is used in various areas of mathematics, including the definition of binary operations and direct products of groups, but it is not directly involved in the definition or understanding of solvable groups.\\n\\nThus, the concept of a Cartesian product is not necessary to define or understand a solvable group. The definition of solvable groups can be fully understood and applied without reference to the Cartesian product.",
