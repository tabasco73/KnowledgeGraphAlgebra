            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Group Action explicitly requires the concept of a Group. In the definition of a Group Action, it starts with 'Let $G$ be a group and $X$ a set.' This indicates that the concept of a group must already be understood and defined for the definition of a group action to be meaningful. The group action relies on the properties of a group, such as the existence of a unit element and the associative property, to define how elements of the group interact with elements of another set $X$. Without the concept of a group, the operations and properties described in the definition of a group action would lack the necessary context and structure, making the concept of a group action incoherent.",
