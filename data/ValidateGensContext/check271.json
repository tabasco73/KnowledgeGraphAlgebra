                "Explanation": "The definition of a solvable group involves a sequence of subgroups where each successive subgroup is normal in the previous one, and the quotient groups formed are abelian. An abelian group, by definition, is a group where the group operation is commutative. Thus, the concept of the Commutative Law is inherently used in the definition of solvable groups because it is essential for the abelian nature of the quotient groups. Therefore, understanding and defining the Commutative Law is necessary to fully grasp what it means for these quotient groups to be abelian, which is a central part of the definition of a solvable group.",
