(ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$.

                "Explanation": "According to the provided definition of a Group, one of the essential properties is that every element of the group must admit an inverse. This is explicitly stated as part of the definition, where it is required that for every element 'a' in the group, there exists an element 'b' such that 'ab = e = ba', where 'e' is the identity element of the group. This requirement is fundamental to the structure of a group and distinguishes a group from other algebraic structures like semigroups or monoids, which do not necessarily require every element to have an inverse.\\n\\nThe concept of an Inverse of an Element is directly tied to this requirement. The definition of an inverse in a monoid, which is a more general structure than a group, specifies that an element 'b' is an inverse of 'a' if 'ab = e = ba'. This definition is necessary to fulfill the group's requirement that every element has an inverse. Without the concept of an inverse of an element, the definition of a group would be incomplete and the algebraic structure would not function as defined.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an Inverse of an Element is essential and needs to be defined for the definition of a Group to make sense, as it is integral to the group's operation and structure.",
