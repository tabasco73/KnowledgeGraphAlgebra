                "Explanation": "The definition of a Factor Ring involves an ideal \\\\mathfrak{a} and the ring R, and it focuses on constructing a new ring by considering the cosets of \\\\mathfrak{a} in R. The operations in the factor ring R / \\\\mathfrak{a} are defined based on the addition and multiplication in R, adjusted by the ideal \\\\mathfrak{a}. The definition of the factor ring does not inherently require the concept of the product of two ideals. The product of ideals, defined as \\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\cdot \\\\mathfrak{b}, involves combining elements from two ideals \\\\mathfrak{a} and \\\\mathfrak{b} to form a new ideal. This concept is separate and not necessary for the definition or understanding of a factor ring, which only requires one ideal and its interaction with the ring R. Therefore, the concept of a product of ideals is not needed for the definition of a factor ring to make sense.",
