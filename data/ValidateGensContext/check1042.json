                "Explanation": "The definition of a Minimal Polynomial inherently involves the concept of a field extension. Specifically, the minimal polynomial is defined for an element \\(\\alpha\\) that is in a larger field \\(L\\), extending a base field \\(K\\). The minimal polynomial is the monic polynomial of the lowest degree in \\(K[X]\\) that has \\(\\alpha\\) as a root, where \\(\\alpha\\) is an element of the field extension \\(L\\) and is algebraic over \\(K\\). This definition cannot be formulated without the concept of a field extension, as it relies on the existence of an element \\(\\alpha\\) that is in a field \\(L\\) extending \\(K\\) and the polynomial ring \\(K[X]\\) from which the minimal polynomial is drawn. Therefore, the concept of an Algebraic Field Extension is necessary for the definition of a Minimal Polynomial to make sense.",
