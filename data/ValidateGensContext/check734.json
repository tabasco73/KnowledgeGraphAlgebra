                "Explanation": "Kronecker's Construction involves creating an extension field by taking the quotient of a polynomial ring by an ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. This process inherently requires the concept of a polynomial ring, as it is the structure from which the quotient is taken. The polynomial ring provides the necessary algebraic framework to define the operations and elements involved in Kronecker's Construction. Without the definition of a polynomial ring, the operations and the structure required to perform Kronecker's Construction would not be properly defined, making the concept of Kronecker's Construction incomplete and incoherent.",
