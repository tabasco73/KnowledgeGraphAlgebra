                "Explanation": "Kronecker's construction involves the concept of a polynomial ring, which is a set of polynomials. The base field itself, over which the polynomial ring is defined, is also a set of elements. Furthermore, the construction uses the concept of an ideal, which is a specific subset of the polynomial ring, and thus a set. The quotient of the polynomial ring by the ideal results in a quotient field, which again can be considered a set of equivalence classes of polynomials. Therefore, the understanding and definition of a set are fundamental to describing the elements, operations, and structures involved in Kronecker's construction.",
