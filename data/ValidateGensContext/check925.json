                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the degree of a polynomial is necessary for defining a splitting field of a family of polynomials, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a splitting field of a family of polynomials involves the decomposition of each polynomial in the family into linear factors over an extension field L. This definition focuses on the factorization properties of the polynomials and the field extension generated by the roots of these polynomials.\\n\\n2. The definition of the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable X for which the coefficient is non-zero. This concept is used to describe the highest exponent in a polynomial expression.\\n\\nIn the definition of a splitting field, there is no explicit requirement to know the degree of the polynomials. The essential requirement is that each polynomial can be completely factored into linear factors in the extension field L. Knowing the degree of the polynomials is not necessary for this factorization to occur or for the field L to be defined as a splitting field. The degree of a polynomial might influence the number of roots and hence the complexity of the field extension, but it is not a prerequisite for defining what a splitting field is.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of the degree of a polynomial is not necessary for the definition of a splitting field of a family of polynomials to make sense.",
