                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Set is necessary for the definition of a Field Extension, we need to analyze the underlying structure of these concepts:\\n\\n1. A Field is a set equipped with two operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain axioms (associativity, commutativity, distributivity, existence of identity and inverses for both operations).\\n\\n2. A Field Extension involves two fields, $K$ and $L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This means that both $K$ and $L$ are themselves sets, as each field is fundamentally a set with additional structure and properties.\\n\\n3. The definition of a Field Extension explicitly relies on the concept of a field, which in turn relies on the concept of a set. Without the concept of a set, the structure of a field cannot be established, as a field is defined as a particular kind of set with additional operations and properties.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a Set is foundational and necessary for defining what a Field is, and subsequently, what a Field Extension is. Without understanding and defining what a set is, the concepts of fields and field extensions would lack the necessary foundational basis.",
