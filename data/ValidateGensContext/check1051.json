                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a subset is necessary for the definition of a submonoid, we need to analyze the definition of a submonoid. According to the provided definition, a submonoid is described as a subset $H \\subset G$ of a monoid $G$ that satisfies certain properties. Specifically, the definition of a submonoid starts by identifying $H$ as a subset of $G$. This implies that the concept of a subset is inherently used in defining what a submonoid is. Without understanding what a subset is, one cannot comprehend the meaning of $H \\subset G$, which is fundamental to the definition of a submonoid. Therefore, the concept of a subset is essential for the definition of a submonoid to make sense, as it forms the basis on which further properties of the submonoid (like closure under the monoid operation and containing the identity element) are built.",
