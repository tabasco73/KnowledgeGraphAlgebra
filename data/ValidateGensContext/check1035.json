                "Explanation": "The concept of an algebraic element is defined independently of the concept of a Galois group. An algebraic element is defined solely based on its relationship to a polynomial equation with coefficients in a base field $K$. Specifically, an element $\\alpha \\in L$ is algebraic over $K$ if there exists a polynomial with coefficients in $K$ that $\\alpha$ satisfies. This definition requires only the concepts of fields, elements, and polynomials.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Galois group of a field extension involves the study of symmetries in the field extension, specifically automorphisms that fix the elements of the base field $K$. While the Galois group is a deeper exploration of the structure of field extensions, particularly those that are normal and separable, it is not necessary to define or understand what an algebraic element is. The definition of an algebraic element does not rely on or require the concept of automorphisms or the Galois group.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of an algebraic element can be fully understood and applied without reference to the Galois group of a field extension.",
