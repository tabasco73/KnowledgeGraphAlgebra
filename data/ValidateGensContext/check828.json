                "Explanation": "The definition of a Field of Fractions explicitly requires an integral domain $R$ as its starting point. The field of fractions $Q(R)$ is constructed from the elements of $R$ where $R$ must be an integral domain to ensure that the operations within $Q(R)$ are well-defined and that $Q(R)$ itself forms a field. Specifically, the absence of zero divisors in $R$ is crucial for defining the equivalence relation $(a, b) \\sim (a', b')$ if and only if $ab' = a'b$, which ensures that this relation is well-defined and meaningful. Without the properties of an integral domain, such as the lack of zero divisors and commutativity, the construction of a field of fractions might not be possible or might not result in a field. Therefore, the concept of an integral domain is necessary for the definition of a field of fractions to make sense.",
