            "Let $G$ be a monoid. A subset $H \\subset G$ is called a submonoid if $H$ satisfies the following conditions: (i) $e \\in H$, (ii) $a, b \\in H \\Longrightarrow a b \\in H$. If $G$ is a group, $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if in addition, (iii) $a \\in H \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\in H$. In particular, a subgroup of a group $G$ is a submonoid that is closed under the process of taking inverses. In defining a subgroup $H \\subset G$, condition (i) can be weakened by simply requiring $H \\neq \\emptyset$, since this implies $e \\in H$ using (ii) and (iii). Of course, similar reasoning is not possible for monoids. Every group $G$ admits $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ as trivial subgroups. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the set $m \\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integral multiples of $m$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}$. We will see in 1.3/4 that all subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of this type. More generally, every element $a$ of a group $G$ gives rise to a so-called cyclic subgroup of $G$. It consists of all powers $a^{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where we put $a^{n}=\\left(a^{-1}\\right)^{-n}$ for $n<0; see also Section 1.3."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Factor Group explicitly requires the concept of a normal subgroup, which is a specific type of subgroup. A normal subgroup is defined as a subgroup $N$ of a group $G$ such that $gNg^{-1} = N$ for all $g$ in $G$. This definition inherently relies on the concept of a subgroup, as a normal subgroup must first meet all the criteria of being a subgroup before additional properties (like normality) are considered. Therefore, understanding what a subgroup is, is essential to defining what a normal subgroup is, and subsequently, what a Factor Group is. Without the concept of a subgroup, the definition of a normal subgroup would not make sense, and thus the concept of a Factor Group would also lack a foundational basis.",
