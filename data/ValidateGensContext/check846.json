                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Extension involves a pair (S, R) where S is a subring of R. This definition focuses solely on the relationship between two rings, S and R, where S is a subset of R that itself forms a ring under the same operations as R. It does not require any additional structure or mappings from another ring outside of S and R.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of an Algebra over a Ring involves a ring homomorphism from a ring A to another ring B, and it requires that B, as an algebra, respects the structure of A through this homomorphism. This concept is more complex and involves a mapping that must respect the operations of A in B.\\n\\nGiven these definitions, the concept of a Ring Extension does not inherently require the concept of an Algebra over a Ring. A Ring Extension is simply about one ring being a subring of another, without any need for a homomorphism from an external ring, as is required in the definition of an Algebra over a Ring.",
