                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the image of a ring homomorphism is necessary for the definition of a finite ring homomorphism, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a finite ring homomorphism states that a ring homomorphism \\(\\varphi: A \\longrightarrow B\\) is finite if \\(B\\) is a finite \\(A\\)-module under \\(\\varphi\\). This definition focuses on the structure of \\(B\\) as an \\(A\\)-module, which is influenced by how \\(\\varphi\\) maps elements from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\).\\n\\n2. The definition of the image of a ring homomorphism is \\(\\operatorname{im} \\varphi = \\varphi(R)\\), which is a subring of \\(R'\\). This concept identifies the subset of \\(R'\\) that consists of all values that can be reached by applying \\(\\varphi\\) to elements of \\(R\\).\\n\\n3. The definition of a finite ring homomorphism does not explicitly require the concept of the image of \\(\\varphi\\). It primarily concerns whether \\(B\\) can be regarded as a finite module over \\(A\\), based on the mapping defined by \\(\\varphi\\). The finiteness condition relates to the algebraic structure and the module properties of \\(B\\) over \\(A\\), rather than the specific elements that \\(\\varphi\\) maps to in \\(B\\).\\n\\n4. While understanding the image of \\(\\varphi\\) can provide additional insights into the nature of the homomorphism and its effects on the structure of \\(B\\), it is not a prerequisite for defining or understanding the concept of a finite ring homomorphism. The essential aspect is the module structure and not the specific set of elements mapped to by \\(\\varphi\\).",
