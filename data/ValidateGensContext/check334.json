                "Explanation": "The Klein Four-Group, denoted as \\(\\mathfrak{V}_{4}\\), is defined as a subgroup of \\(\\mathfrak{S}_{4}\\) consisting of specific permutations. It is also stated to be isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z} / 2 \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} / 2 \\mathbb{Z}\\), which is a direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2. Each of these cyclic groups is commutative, and the direct product of commutative groups is also commutative. Therefore, the group operation in the Klein Four-Group is commutative, meaning that it satisfies the Commutative Law.\\n\\nThe Commutative Law states that a law of composition on a set \\(M\\) is commutative if \\(ab = ba\\) for all elements \\(a, b \\in M\\). For the definition of the Klein Four-Group to fully make sense and to understand its structure and properties, it is essential to know that its operation is commutative. This is inherent in its isomorphism to \\(\\mathbb{Z} / 2 \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} / 2 \\mathbb{Z}\\), which implies that the group operation obeys the Commutative Law.\\n\\nThus, the concept of the Commutative Law is necessary to understand the nature of the Klein Four-Group's operation and its algebraic structure. Without this concept, the explanation of the group's properties, especially its commutativity, would be incomplete.",
