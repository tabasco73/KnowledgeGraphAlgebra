            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Frobenius homomorphism specifically pertains to fields, which are algebraic structures with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties, including the existence of inverses for every non-zero element under multiplication. This makes every non-zero element of a field form a group under multiplication.\\n\\nHowever, the concept of a group in general is broader and includes any set with a binary operation that satisfies associativity, has an identity element, and where every element has an inverse. The definition of a Frobenius homomorphism does not require the general concept of a group but specifically deals with the properties of fields. While fields inherently include a multiplicative group (excluding zero), the definition of the Frobenius homomorphism itself focuses on the field properties and the behavior of the field under the Frobenius map, which is a specific type of field homomorphism.\\n\\nTherefore, while fields (and thus the multiplicative group within them) are essential to the definition of a Frobenius homomorphism, the general concept of a group as defined is not necessary for understanding or defining a Frobenius homomorphism.",
