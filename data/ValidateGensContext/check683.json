                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of a 'System of generators' to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a 'System of generators' states that it is a family (x_i)_{i in I} of elements of an A-module M. This implies that each x_i is an element of the set M.\\n\\n2. The concept of an 'Element of a Set' defines what it means for something to be an element of a set, i.e., an object belonging to a set.\\n\\n3. Since the definition of a 'System of generators' relies on the notion of elements (x_i) being part of a set (the A-module M), it inherently requires the understanding of what it means for these x_i to be elements of M.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of an 'Element of a Set', we would not have a clear understanding of what it means for x_i to belong to M, and thus the definition of a 'System of generators' would lack clarity and completeness.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of a 'System of generators' to be meaningful and complete.",
