                "Explanation": "According to the provided definition of a Monoid, it is a set $M$ with a law of composition $\\sigma: M \\times M \\longrightarrow M$ that is associative and admits a unit element with respect to $\\sigma$. This definition explicitly requires the existence of a unit or neutral element as part of the structure of a monoid. The unit element is essential because it must satisfy the condition $ea = a = ae$ for all $a \\in M$, which ensures that every element in the set can interact with the unit element without changing. The presence of such a unit element is not just an additional feature but a fundamental requirement for the definition of a monoid. Therefore, the concept of a unit or neutral element is necessary for the definition of a monoid to be complete and meaningful.",
