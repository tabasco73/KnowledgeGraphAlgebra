                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the Commutative Law needs to be defined for the definition of a Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field to make sense, we need to analyze the properties of a group and the specific properties of a finite field.\\n\\n1. A group, by definition, is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies three properties: closure, associativity, and the existence of an identity element and inverses for every element in the group.\\n\\n2. The definition of a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ implies that it is a field, which means it not only satisfies the properties of a group under addition (including the existence of additive inverses) but also forms a multiplicative group with its nonzero elements under multiplication. This multiplicative group is denoted as $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$.\\n\\n3. Importantly, the operation of multiplication in any field, including finite fields, is commutative. This means that for any elements $a, b$ in the field, the equation $ab = ba$ holds. Therefore, the commutative property is inherently a part of the structure of a finite field's multiplication.\\n\\n4. Since the commutative property of multiplication is a given in the context of finite fields, the concept of the Commutative Law is implicitly required and understood in the definition of the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field. Without the commutative property, the definition of a finite field and consequently the structure of its multiplicative group would not hold as described.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of the Commutative Law is necessary for the definition of the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field to fully make sense, as it ensures that the multiplication operation within the group behaves as expected in a field.",
