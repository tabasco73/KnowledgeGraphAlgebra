According to the provided definition, a right coset of a subgroup $H$ in a group $G$ is described as a subset of $G$ of the form $Ha = \\{ha; h \\in H\\}$, where $a \\in G$. This definition explicitly states that a right coset is a subset of $G$. Therefore, understanding what a subset is becomes crucial to comprehending the definition of a right coset. Without the concept of a subset, one would not be able to grasp the meaning of a right coset being a collection of elements from $G$ that forms a particular kind of subset. Hence, the concept of a subset is indeed necessary for the definition of a right coset to make sense.",
