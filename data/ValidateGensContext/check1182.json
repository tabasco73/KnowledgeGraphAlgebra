                "Explanation": "The concept of the image of a ring homomorphism involves the mapping of elements from one ring to another via a function that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication). The definition of the image of a ring homomorphism does not specify that either the domain ring R or the codomain ring R' must be commutative. It only requires that they are rings and that the mapping preserves the ring structure.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a commutative ring is specifically defined by the property that its multiplication operation is commutative. This property is not a prerequisite for the definition or understanding of a ring homomorphism or its image. The concept of a ring homomorphism and its image can be fully understood and applied whether or not the involved rings are commutative.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a commutative ring is not necessary for the definition of the image of a ring homomorphism to make sense. The essential requirement is the existence of ring structures and a homomorphism between them, not the commutativity of these rings.",
