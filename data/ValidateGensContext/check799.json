            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Prime Ideal inherently relies on the structure of a ring. Specifically, the definition states that a prime ideal is a proper subset of a ring $R$ and involves the multiplication operation within $R$. The condition that $ab \\in \\mathfrak{p}$ implies $a \\in \\mathfrak{p}$ or $b \\in \\mathfrak{p}$ directly uses the ring's multiplication operation. Without the concept of a ring, which defines these operations and the set $R$, the notion of a prime ideal would not have a meaningful context or framework. Therefore, the concept of a ring is essential for the definition of a prime ideal to make sense.",
