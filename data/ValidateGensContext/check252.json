                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a field is necessary for the definition of a Galois extension to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a Galois extension. The definition states that an extension $K_{r} / K$ is Galois if it is both normal and separable. This definition inherently involves two fields: $K_{r}$ and $K$. The notation $K_{r} / K$ indicates that $K_{r}$ is an extension field of $K$, meaning $K_{r}$ contains $K$ and both share the same algebraic structure, specifically that of a field.\\n\\nThe properties of being normal and separable are defined in the context of field theory. A field extension being normal means that the extension field includes all roots of polynomials (with coefficients in the smaller field) that are irreducible over the smaller field. A field extension being separable means that the minimal polynomial of any element in the extension field does not have repeated roots.\\n\\nWithout the concept of a field, the notions of normality and separability would not have a meaningful context, as these properties rely on the algebraic structure provided by fields. Therefore, the concept of a field is essential for the definition of a Galois extension to be meaningful and applicable.",
