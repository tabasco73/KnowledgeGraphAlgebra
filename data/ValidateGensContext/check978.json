            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of a Symmetric Group to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Symmetric Group states that it is the group of all bijective self-maps of the set \\{1, ..., n\\}. This definition inherently uses the term 'group', implying that the set of bijective self-maps forms a group under some operation, which in this case is the composition of functions.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Group provides the necessary properties and structure that a set must have to be considered a group. These include associativity, the existence of a unit element, and the existence of inverses for every element.\\n\\n3. Since the definition of a Symmetric Group refers to it as a 'group', it presupposes the understanding of what a group is, including its structural properties like associativity, identity, and inverses. Without the concept of a Group, the term 'group' in the definition of a Symmetric Group would be undefined and unclear.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Group is essential for the definition of a Symmetric Group to be meaningful and complete. Without understanding what a group is, one cannot fully comprehend what is meant by a Symmetric Group being a group of bijective self-maps.",
