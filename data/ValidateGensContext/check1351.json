                "Explanation": "The definition of a Monoid explicitly states that the law of composition \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) must be associative. This means that for any elements \\\\(a, b, c \\\\in M\\\\), the operation must satisfy the condition \\\\(\\sigma(\\sigma(a, b), c) = \\sigma(a, \\sigma(b, c))\\\\). This condition directly references the concept of an Associative Law, which defines a law of composition as associative if \\\\( (ab)c = a(bc) \\\\) for all elements \\\\(a, b, c\\\\) in the set. Therefore, understanding and defining the Associative Law is essential for the definition of a Monoid, as it specifies one of the core properties that the law of composition \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) must fulfill in order for the set \\\\(M\\\\) to be considered a monoid.",
