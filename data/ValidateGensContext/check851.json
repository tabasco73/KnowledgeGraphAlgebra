A homomorphism between two $A$-algebras $B$ and $C$ is a ring homomorphism $B \\longrightarrow C$ that is compatible with the defining homomorphisms $A \\longrightarrow B$ and $A \\longrightarrow C$, ensuring the commutativity of the diagram involving these maps."

                "Explanation": "The concept of an extension field focuses on the properties and structure of fields derived from a base field, specifically involving the number of elements and the characteristic polynomial. The definition provided for an extension field involves fields and polynomials, and it is primarily concerned with field theory, particularly finite fields and their properties.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of an algebra over a ring involves a broader algebraic structure where a ring acts on another ring via a ring homomorphism, creating a structure that can be studied in the context of both ring theory and module theory. This concept is more general and can apply to various algebraic structures beyond just fields.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding and defining an extension field does not inherently require the concept of an algebra over a ring. The definition and study of extension fields can be fully addressed within the framework of field theory without necessarily involving the algebraic structures and homomorphisms characteristic of algebras over rings.",
