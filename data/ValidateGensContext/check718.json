                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of an extension field, we need to analyze the components of the definition of an extension field:\\n\\n1. An extension field $\\mathbb{F}_q / \\mathbb{F}_p$ is described as a field consisting of $q=p^n$ elements. Here, the notion of 'elements' and their collection into a structure (the field) inherently relies on the concept of a set, as a set is fundamentally a collection of distinct objects.\\n\\n2. The definition further specifies that this field is a splitting field of a polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. The concept of a field itself is built upon the idea of sets, as a field in mathematics is a set equipped with two operations (addition and multiplication) that follow certain axioms.\\n\\n3. The polynomial $X^q - X$ and its roots form a set, which is crucial in defining the extension field as its splitting field.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the definition and understanding of an extension field rely on the concept of a set. Without the concept of a set, the notion of 'collection of elements' and the algebraic structure of a field cannot be properly defined or understood.",
