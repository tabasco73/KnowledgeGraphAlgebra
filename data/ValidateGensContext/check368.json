                "Explanation": "The concept of a reduced ideal involves the notion of an ideal and the radical of an ideal in a ring. The definition of a reduced ideal states that an ideal \\\\(\\textbackslash{}mathfrak{a}\\\\) in a ring \\\\textit{R}\\\\ is reduced if \\\\(\\textbackslash{}mathfrak{a} = \\textbackslash{}operatorname{rad} \\textbackslash{}mathfrak{a}\\\\), where the radical of an ideal \\\\(\\textbackslash{}operatorname{rad} \\textbackslash{}mathfrak{a}\\\\) includes elements \\\\textit{a}\\\\ in \\\\textit{R}\\\\ such that \\\\textit{a}^{n}\\\\ is in \\\\(\\textbackslash{}mathfrak{a}\\\\) for some \\\\textit{n}\\\\ in \\\\(\\textbackslash{}mathbb{N}\\\\). This definition is self-contained within the context of ring theory and does not inherently require the concept of a polynomial. A polynomial is a formal sum of terms with coefficients and powers of a variable, typically used in algebraic contexts but not necessary for defining what an ideal or its radical is in ring theory. Therefore, understanding or defining a reduced ideal does not depend on the concept of a polynomial.",
