(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a zero divisor explicitly states that it is an element 'a' of a ring 'R'. This implies that the concept of a ring must already be established and understood for the concept of a zero divisor to be meaningful. Without the structure of a ring, the operations and elements referred to in the definition of a zero divisor would not have a context or framework in which they operate. Therefore, the concept of a ring is necessary to define what a zero divisor is, as it provides the essential properties and operations (addition and multiplication) that are used to determine whether an element is a zero divisor.",
