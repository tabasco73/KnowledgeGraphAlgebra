                "Explanation": "The concept of an irreducible element is defined within the context of an integral domain, which is a type of ring where every nonzero element is not a zero divisor. The definition of an irreducible element does not inherently require the structure of a field, but rather just the properties of an integral domain. A field, by definition, is a commutative division ring, meaning every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. In a field, every nonzero element is a unit, and thus there are no irreducible elements in a field because every element can be factored into units. Therefore, the concept of an irreducible element is meaningful primarily in the context of rings that are not fields. The definition of a field is not necessary to understand or apply the concept of an irreducible element in an integral domain or other ring structures.",
