                "Explanation": "The concept of a left coset involves the formation of subsets within a group by multiplying a fixed element from the group with every element of a subgroup. The definition of a left coset itself does not explicitly require the associative law; it primarily relies on the ability to multiply an element of the group with elements of the subgroup.\\n\\nHowever, the underlying structure where left cosets are defined is a group, and one of the fundamental properties of a group is that its operation must be associative. This means that for any elements $a, b, c$ in the group, the operation must satisfy $(ab)c = a(bc)$. This associative property is crucial for the group operation to be well-defined and for the group structure to hold, which indirectly affects the structure and properties of left cosets.\\n\\nTherefore, while the definition of a left coset does not directly invoke the associative law, the existence and properties of left cosets are predicated on the group's operation being associative. Thus, the associative law is necessary for the coherent definition and operation of groups, and consequently for the concept of left cosets to make sense.",
