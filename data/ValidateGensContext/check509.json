            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a reduced ideal explicitly mentions that it is an ideal in a ring R. This implies that the concept of a ring must be established first, as the ideal is defined within the context of a ring. Furthermore, the definition of a reduced ideal involves operations and elements (like the radical of an ideal) that are inherently linked to the structure and properties of a ring. Therefore, without the concept of a ring, the definition of a reduced ideal would not have a meaningful or applicable context.",
