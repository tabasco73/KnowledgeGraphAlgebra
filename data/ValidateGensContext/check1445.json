This definition inherently requires the concept of a separable extension, as it is explicitly mentioned as a criterion. Without understanding what a separable extension is, one cannot fully comprehend or apply the definition of a Galois extension. Therefore, the concept of a separable extension is necessary for the definition of a Galois extension to be meaningful and complete.",
