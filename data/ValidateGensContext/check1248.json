                "Explanation": "The definition of an Ideal requires the existence of a ring, R, but does not specify that the ring must be commutative. The definition of an Ideal involves two conditions: (i) being an additive subgroup of R, and (ii) closure under multiplication by any element of R. These conditions can be satisfied in both commutative and non-commutative rings. Therefore, the concept of a commutative ring is not necessary for the definition of an Ideal to make sense. An Ideal can exist in any type of ring, whether it is commutative or not.",
