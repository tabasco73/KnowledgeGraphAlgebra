                "Explanation": "The concept of a Monoid involves a set with an associative binary operation and a unit element. A Group, which is a more specific structure than a Monoid, requires all the properties of a Monoid plus the existence of inverses for every element.\\n\\nThe Galois group of a field extension, as defined, is a group of automorphisms. This means it inherently has the properties of a group: closure under composition, associativity, the existence of an identity element (the identity automorphism), and the existence of inverses (the inverse automorphisms).\\n\\nWhile the definition of a Monoid is a foundational concept in algebra, the definition of a Galois group specifically requires the structure of a Group, not just a Monoid. The properties of a Monoid are subsumed within those of a Group, but the existence of inverses, which is not required for Monoids, is crucial for the definition of a Galois group.\\n\\nTherefore, while understanding Monoids might provide useful background knowledge, the concept of a Monoid itself is not necessary for the definition of a Galois group of a field extension, which specifically relies on the properties of a Group.",
