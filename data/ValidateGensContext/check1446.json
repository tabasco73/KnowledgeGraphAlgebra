The Galois group of a field extension $L/K$, denoted as $\\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$, is defined as the group of all field automorphisms of $L$ that fix every element of $K$. This definition does not inherently require the extension to be normal or separable; it merely specifies a group structure based on automorphisms that preserve the structure of $K$ within $L$.\\n\\n2. A Galois extension is defined as an extension $K_r/K$ that is both normal and separable. This definition introduces additional properties (normality and separability) that are not mentioned in the definition of the Galois group.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Galois group of a field extension can be defined independently of whether the extension is Galois. The definition of the Galois group focuses on the automorphisms and does not require the extension to be normal or separable. Therefore, the concept of a Galois extension is not necessary for the definition of a Galois group of a field extension to make sense.",
