                "Explanation": "The definition of a Frobenius homomorphism involves a field $K$ of characteristic $p>0$ and a specific map $\\\\(\\sigma: K \\longrightarrow K, \\\\quad a \\longmapsto a^{p}\\\\)$ that respects the addition on $K$. This definition is self-contained and only requires the concept of a field and its characteristic. It does not require the concept of one ring being a subring of another or any relation between two different rings, which is the essence of a ring extension.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a ring extension involves a pair (S, R) where S is a subring of R. This concept is about the relationship between two rings, where one is a subset of the other.\\n\\nSince the definition of a Frobenius homomorphism does not involve any relationship between two different rings, but rather a specific operation within a single field, the concept of a ring extension is not necessary for defining or understanding a Frobenius homomorphism.",
