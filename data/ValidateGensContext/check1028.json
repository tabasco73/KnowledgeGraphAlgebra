                "Explanation": "The definition of the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension explicitly mentions that the group is cyclic of order $n$, where $n$ is the degree of the extension. This indicates that the concept of the degree of the extension is integral to defining the Galois group itself. The degree of the extension ($[\\mathbb{F}_{q'} : \\mathbb{F}_q]$) quantifies how many times larger the extended field $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ is compared to the base field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and this number ($n$) directly determines the order of the Galois group. Therefore, without the concept of the degree of a field extension, one cannot define the order of the Galois group, which is a crucial part of its structure as described in the definition.",
