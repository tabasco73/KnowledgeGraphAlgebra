                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a submonoid, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a submonoid. The definition states that a submonoid is a subset $H \\subset G$ of a monoid $G$. A subset, by definition, is a set that contains some or all elements of another set while still adhering to the properties of a set. Therefore, the concept of a subset inherently relies on the concept of a set. \\n\\nIn the definition of a submonoid, it is crucial that $H$ is a subset, meaning it must first be a set itself. The properties that $H$ must satisfy (containing the identity element and being closed under the operation of the monoid) are properties that relate to elements within this set. Without the concept of a set, the notion of a subset would not exist, and thus the structure and requirements of a submonoid could not be defined. Hence, the concept of a set is essential for the definition of a submonoid to make sense.",
