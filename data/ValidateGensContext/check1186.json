                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a commutative ring is necessary for defining the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. **Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension**: This concept involves the group of field automorphisms of a finite field extension that fix a smaller field. This definition inherently requires the understanding of fields, field extensions, and automorphisms.\\n\\n2. **Field and Field Extension**: A field is a special kind of ring that is both commutative and has multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements. A field extension occurs when one field is a subset of another, larger field, and both share the same additive and multiplicative identities.\\n\\n3. **Commutative Ring**: This is a ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. Since every field is a commutative ring (with additional properties), understanding fields implicitly requires understanding commutative rings.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a commutative ring is foundational to the concept of a field. Since the definition of the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension relies on the concept of fields and field extensions, it indirectly depends on the concept of commutative rings. Therefore, understanding commutative rings is necessary for the definition of the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension to make sense.",
