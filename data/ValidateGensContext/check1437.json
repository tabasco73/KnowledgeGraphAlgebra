                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a prime subfield of a finite field is necessary for defining the splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield, we need to analyze the dependencies between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Prime Subfield**: The prime subfield of a finite field $\\mathbb{F}$, denoted $\\mathbb{F}_p$, is the smallest subfield within $\\mathbb{F}$, characterized by the characteristic $p$ of $\\mathbb{F}$. This subfield is essentially the field of integers modulo $p$, which is a finite field of prime order.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Splitting Field**: A field $\\mathbb{F}$ is a splitting field of the polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$ if $X^q-X$ factorizes into linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}$. This definition inherently requires the concept of the prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$ as the base field over which the polynomial is considered.\\n\\n3. **Dependency**: The definition of the splitting field explicitly mentions and relies on the prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$. Without the concept of the prime subfield, it would be unclear over which field the polynomial $X^q-X$ is supposed to split. The prime subfield provides the necessary framework and reference point for considering the factorization of the polynomial.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: The concept of the prime subfield is integral to defining the splitting field of $X^q-X$ over it. Without this concept, the definition of the splitting field would lack a clear and specific reference to the base field, making it incomplete and ambiguous.",
