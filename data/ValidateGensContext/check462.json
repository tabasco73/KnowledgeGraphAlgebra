The concept of a set is fundamental here because a finite field is essentially a set of elements structured in a particular way (with operations of addition and multiplication that satisfy field axioms). Without the concept of a set, we cannot define what it means for a finite field to consist of elements, as the notion of 'collection of distinct objects' (elements in this case) is inherent in the definition of a set. Therefore, the concept of a set is necessary to establish the basic structure of a finite field, which is a set with additional algebraic properties.",
