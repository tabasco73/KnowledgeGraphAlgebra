                "Explanation": "The concept of a splitting field of a polynomial involves a field $K$ and a field extension $L$ of $K$. In the context of fields, the operations of addition and multiplication are inherently commutative. This means that for any elements $a, b$ in the field, both $a + b = b + a$ and $ab = ba$ hold. Therefore, the nature of fields inherently includes the commutative law for both addition and multiplication.\\n\\nThe definition of a splitting field does not explicitly require the definition of the commutative law because the commutativity of operations is a fundamental property of fields, which is the underlying structure in the definition of a splitting field. The concept of a field inherently assumes that the operations are commutative, so the commutative law does not need to be separately defined or stated for the concept of a splitting field to make sense.",
