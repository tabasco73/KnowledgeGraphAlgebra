                "Explanation": "The definition of a p-group involves the concept of a group, which inherently includes the associative law as part of its definition. A group, by definition, is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies three axioms: closure, associativity, and the existence of an identity element and inverses for each element in the set. Therefore, the associative law is a fundamental part of the definition of any group, including p-groups. Since a p-group is a type of group, the associative law must already be satisfied for the concept of a p-group to make sense. Thus, the associative law does not need to be separately defined for the definition of a p-group to be valid; it is implicitly included within the broader definition of a group.",
