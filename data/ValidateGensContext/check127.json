                "Explanation": "The concept of a system of generators is defined within the context of an A-module M, where A is a ring. This definition requires that every element of M can be expressed as a sum of elements from A multiplied by elements from the set (x_i)_{i in I}. This definition inherently relies on the structure of A as a ring and the module operations, but it does not require A to be an algebra over some other ring, nor does it require the existence of any ring homomorphism from A to another ring or algebra.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of an algebra over a ring involves a ring homomorphism from a ring A to another structure B, which is also a ring, and ensures that B behaves in a way that respects the ring structure of A. This concept is more about the relationship between two ring structures and the mapping between them.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a system of generators for an A-module does not depend on the concept of an algebra over a ring. The system of generators can be fully understood and applied within the context of ring and module theory without involving the additional structure of an algebra over a ring.",
