            "A field $K$ is called algebraically closed if every nonconstant polynomial $f$ of $K[X]$ admits a zero in $K$, or in other words, if $f$ decomposes in $K[X]$ into a product of linear factors. This means that $f$ admits a product decomposition $f=c \\prod_{i}\\left(X-\\alpha_{i}\\right)$ with a constant $c \\in K^{*}$ as well as zeros $\\alpha_{i} \\in K$."

                "Explanation": "The concept of an extension field, as defined, involves a field derived from a base field by extending the number of elements to a power of the size of the base field. The definition specifically mentions that the extension field is a splitting field of the polynomial $X^q - X$ over the base field $\\mathbb{F}_p$. This polynomial splits completely into linear factors in the extension field, indicating that every element of the extension field is a root of the polynomial.\\n\\nThe concept of an algebraically closed field, on the other hand, is a field in which every nonconstant polynomial has a root, and thus can be factored completely into linear factors within the field itself. While this concept is related to the idea of polynomials splitting into linear factors, it is not necessary for the definition of an extension field. The extension field is defined independently of the field being algebraically closed; it is defined in terms of having a specific number of elements and being a splitting field for a particular polynomial over a smaller field.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an algebraically closed field is not necessary for the definition of an extension field to make sense. The definition of an extension field stands on its own and does not require the field to be algebraically closed, only that a specific polynomial splits completely in it.",
