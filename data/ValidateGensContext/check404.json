                "Explanation": "The concept of a Factor Ring involves the construction of a new ring from an existing ring $R$ and an ideal $\\\\frak{a}$ in $R$. The definition of a Factor Ring focuses on the operations within the ring $R$ and how they are modified by the ideal to form a new ring structure, $R / \\\\frak{a}$. This process does not inherently involve any concept of a subring or an extension of rings. The Factor Ring is essentially about quotienting $R$ by an ideal to form a new ring, not about extending $R$ with a larger ring or embedding $R$ into a larger ring structure.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Ring Extension involves a pair (S, R) where S is a subring of R, indicating that S is contained within R and shares some structural properties with R. This concept is about the relationship between two rings where one is a subset of the other, which is fundamentally different from the concept of forming a quotient ring.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding or defining a Factor Ring does not require the concept of a Ring Extension. The two concepts operate independently in the context of ring theory, with Factor Rings focusing on quotient structures and Ring Extensions focusing on subring relationships.",
