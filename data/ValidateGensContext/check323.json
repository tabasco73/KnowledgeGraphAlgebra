                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Algebraic Element is necessary for defining a Splitting Field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Splitting Field**: A field $\\mathbb{F}$ is a splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$ if $X^q-X$ factorizes into linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}$. This means that every root of $X^q-X$ in $\\mathbb{F}$ is a zero of the polynomial, and each root appears exactly once as a factor.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Algebraic Element**: An element $\\alpha$ in a field extension $L$ of $K$ is algebraic over $K$ if there exists a polynomial with coefficients in $K$ that $\\alpha$ satisfies.\\n\\n3. **Connection Between Concepts**: In the context of the splitting field, the roots of $X^q-X$ in $\\mathbb{F}$ are the elements that make $X^q-X$ factorize completely. These roots are algebraic over the prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$, as they satisfy the polynomial equation $X^q-X = 0$, which is a polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\\n\\n4. **Necessity of Algebraic Element Concept**: Understanding that the roots of $X^q-X$ in $\\mathbb{F}$ are algebraic over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is inherent in the definition of a splitting field. However, explicitly defining these roots as algebraic elements is not strictly necessary for the definition of a splitting field itself. The definition of a splitting field focuses on the factorization of the polynomial into linear factors and does not require the explicit use of the term 'algebraic element'.\\n\\nTherefore, while the roots being algebraic is an implicit aspect of them being zeros of $X^q-X$, the concept of an algebraic element is not strictly necessary for defining a splitting field of $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield.",
