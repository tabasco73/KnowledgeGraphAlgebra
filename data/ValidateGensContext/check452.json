                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the degree of a field extension is necessary for the definition of a splitting field of a family of polynomials, we need to analyze the components of each definition:\\n\\n1. The definition of a splitting field of a family of polynomials involves a field extension \\(L/K\\) where every polynomial in the family decomposes into linear factors in \\(L\\), and \\(L\\) is generated by the zeros of these polynomials. This definition focuses on the algebraic structure and properties required for \\(L\\) to decompose the polynomials completely.\\n\\n2. The degree of a field extension is defined as the dimension of \\(L\\) as a vector space over \\(K\\). This concept quantifies the 'size' or 'complexity' of the extension but does not directly influence the algebraic properties that define a splitting field, such as the ability to decompose polynomials into linear factors or the generation of the field by zeros of the polynomials.\\n\\nFrom these observations, the concept of the degree of a field extension, while providing additional information about the extension, is not necessary for the definition or understanding of what constitutes a splitting field. The splitting field definition is primarily concerned with the algebraic closure properties with respect to a given family of polynomials and does not inherently require knowledge of the degree of the extension.",
