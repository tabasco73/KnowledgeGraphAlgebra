                "Explanation": "Kronecker's construction involves the creation of an extension field by taking the quotient of a polynomial ring over a base field by an ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. This process is focused on algebraic structures related to fields, rings, and polynomials. It does not inherently involve the concept of Cartesian products, which pertains to the formation of ordered pairs from elements of a set. The Cartesian product is a concept from set theory used to describe pairs of elements and is not directly related to the algebraic operations or structures used in Kronecker's construction. Therefore, the definition and understanding of Kronecker's construction do not require the concept of the Cartesian product.",
