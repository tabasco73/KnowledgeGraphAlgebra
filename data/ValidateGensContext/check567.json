                "Explanation": "The concept of a finitely generated module involves a module M over a ring A that can be generated by a finite number of elements from M itself. This definition focuses on the properties of the module M and its relationship with the ring A, specifically that a finite subset of M can generate the entire module through the operations defined by A.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a ring extension involves two rings, S and R, where S is a subring of R. This concept pertains to the relationship between two rings and does not directly relate to the properties of a module over a ring.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding or defining a finitely generated module does not inherently require the concept of a ring extension. The definition of a finitely generated module is self-contained with respect to its relationship with a single ring A and does not necessitate considering a second ring or the relationship between two rings as in a ring extension.",
