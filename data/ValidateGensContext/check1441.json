                "Explanation": "The concept of a Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension inherently involves the notion of an extension field. The definition of the Galois group specifies that it is the group of automorphisms of a field $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ that fix another field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This relationship implies that $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ is an extension of $\\mathbb{F}_q$, as the automorphisms are defined in terms of their action on these fields, specifically fixing the elements of the smaller field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ while permuting those of the larger field $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$. Therefore, the concept of an extension field, where one field is an extension over another, is crucial for defining the Galois group of that extension. Without the concept of an extension field, the definition of a Galois group would not have a framework within which to describe the relationship between $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_q$, making the concept of a Galois group nonsensical in this context.",
