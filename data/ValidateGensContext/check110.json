                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition needs to be defined for the definition of an Algebra over a Ring to make sense, we need to analyze the requirements and structure of an Algebra over a Ring. According to the provided definition, an Algebra over a Ring involves a ring homomorphism from a ring $A$ to another structure $B$. A ring, by definition, is a set equipped with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties such as associativity, distributivity, and the existence of identity elements. These binary operations are examples of laws of composition, as they map pairs of elements from the set (ring) to another element in the same set.\\n\\nGiven that an Algebra over a Ring inherently involves these ring structures, and since rings require laws of composition (addition and multiplication) to be defined, it follows that the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of an Algebra over a Ring. Without laws of composition, the ring structure itself would not be properly defined, and consequently, the concept of an Algebra over a Ring would lack its foundational basis in ring theory.",
