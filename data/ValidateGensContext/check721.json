An integral domain, by definition, is a commutative ring that is nonzero and has no nontrivial zero divisors. Since the definition of a Dedekind Domain includes it being an integral domain, the concept of an integral domain is necessary to fully understand and define what a Dedekind Domain is. Without understanding what an integral domain is, one cannot fully grasp the concept of a Dedekind Domain because the foundational properties of an integral domain are assumed and required for the additional properties of a Dedekind Domain to make sense.",
