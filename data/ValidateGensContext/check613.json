                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Residue class module, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Residue class module mentions it as a quotient of an A-module M by a submodule N. This implies that M is an A-module, which means M is a module over some ring A.\\n\\n2. The concept of a module inherently depends on the concept of a ring because a module is a generalization of the idea of a vector space over a field, but instead over a ring. This means that the operations within the module are defined in terms of the ring operations.\\n\\n3. Therefore, understanding and defining a module (and consequently a Residue class module) requires the concept of a ring, as the module operations are based on the ring's addition and multiplication.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of a ring, the operations and the structure of a module cannot be defined, making it impossible to define what a Residue class module is.\\n\\nHence, the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Residue class module to make sense.",
