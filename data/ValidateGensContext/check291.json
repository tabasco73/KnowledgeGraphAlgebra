                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a right coset, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a right coset. The definition states that a right coset of a subgroup $H$ in a group $G$ is a subset of $G$ formed by multiplying each element of $H$ by a fixed element $a$ from $G$. This results in a collection of elements $Ha = \\{ha; h \\in H\\}$, where each element $ha$ is the product of $h$ from $H$ and $a$ from $G$. \\n\\nThe term 'subset' used in the definition of a right coset inherently refers to the concept of a set, as a subset is a set that contains elements all of which also belong to another set. Therefore, the formation of a right coset directly involves the concept of a set, since the coset itself is described as a collection (set) of elements formed in a specific manner. Without the concept of a set, the notion of a subset and thus the structure of a right coset would not be well-defined or meaningful.",
