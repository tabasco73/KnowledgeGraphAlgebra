            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a maximal ideal inherently relies on the structure of a ring. According to the definition provided, a maximal ideal is a proper ideal within a ring, and its properties are defined in relation to other ideals within the same ring. The concept of an ideal, including a maximal ideal, cannot exist independently without the underlying structure of a ring, as it is defined as a subset of a ring with specific properties related to the ring's operations. Therefore, the concept of a ring must be defined and understood first in order for the concept of a maximal ideal to be meaningful and applicable.",
