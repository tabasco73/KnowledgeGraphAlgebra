                "Explanation": "The concept of a Division Ring focuses on the structure of a ring where every nonzero element is a unit, meaning every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse within the ring. This definition is self-contained and does not reference any group properties directly, such as the order of a group.\\n\\nThe concept of the Order of a group pertains to the number of elements in a group, which is a different algebraic structure. While a ring can be associated with groups (for example, its additive group or the group formed by its units), the definition of a division ring does not inherently require or imply anything about the number of elements in these groups. The order of a group is relevant in group theory but does not influence the definition of a division ring, which is concerned with the existence of inverses for nonzero elements and not with the number of such elements.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of the Order of a group is not necessary for the definition of a Division Ring to make sense. The two concepts operate independently in their respective areas of abstract algebra.",
