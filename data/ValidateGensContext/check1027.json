                "Explanation": "The concept of the degree of a field extension is defined purely in terms of vector space dimensions. Specifically, it involves considering the extension field $L$ as a vector space over the base field $K$ and determining the dimension of this vector space. This definition is self-contained and does not inherently require any properties of the field extension other than it being an extension (i.e., $K \\\\$subset L$).\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Galois extension involves additional properties of the field extension, specifically being normal and separable. These properties are not referenced or required in the definition of the degree of a field extension. The degree of a field extension can be computed and understood entirely independently of whether the extension is Galois.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Galois extension is not necessary for the definition or understanding of the degree of a field extension. The degree of a field extension focuses solely on the dimensionality aspect as a vector space, without consideration of the algebraic structure provided by the normality and separability conditions of a Galois extension.",
