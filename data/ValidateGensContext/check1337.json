                "Explanation": "To define the Cartesian product of a set $M$ with itself, as $M \\times M$, we need to consider all ordered pairs of elements from $M$. An ordered pair $(a, b)$, where both $a$ and $b$ are elements of $M$, is a fundamental component of the Cartesian product. Therefore, the concept of an 'element of a set' is crucial because it specifies what constitutes the members of the set $M$ that are paired in the Cartesian product. Without understanding what an element of a set is, we cannot determine what the pairs in the Cartesian product consist of, making the definition of the Cartesian product reliant on the definition of an element of a set.",
