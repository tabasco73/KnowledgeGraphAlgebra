This means that the concept of a division ring is integral to understanding what a field is. Without the concept of a division ring, one cannot fully grasp the definition of a field, as a field is a special type of division ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. Therefore, the concept of a division ring is necessary for the definition of a field to be complete and understandable.",
