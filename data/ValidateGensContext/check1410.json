The definition of a torsion submodule states that it consists of all torsion elements of an A-module M. This implies that the concept of a torsion element is integral to identifying which elements belong to the torsion submodule.\\n\\n2. Without the concept of a torsion element, we would not have a criterion to determine which elements of the module M should be included in the torsion submodule. The torsion submodule is specifically defined as the collection of torsion elements.\\n\\n3. Therefore, the definition of a torsion submodule is directly dependent on the definition of a torsion element. Without understanding what a torsion element is, one cannot define or identify the torsion submodule of a module.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a torsion element is necessary for the definition of a torsion submodule to make sense.",
