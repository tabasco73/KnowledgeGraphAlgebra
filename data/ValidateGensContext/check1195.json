                "Explanation": "The concept of the stabilizer of a point in a set under a group action involves defining a subset of the group. Specifically, the stabilizer $G_x$ of a point $x$ in $X$ is the set of all elements $g$ in $G$ such that the action of $g$ on $x$ leaves $x$ unchanged, i.e., $g x = x$. This definition requires understanding the group action and the elements of the group, but it does not inherently require knowing the total number of elements in the group, which is what the order of the group specifies.\\n\\nThe order of a group is a measure of the size of the group, either finite or infinite. While the order of the group can provide additional information about the structure of the group and its subgroups, including stabilizers, it is not necessary to define or understand what a stabilizer is. The stabilizer can be defined and understood purely in terms of the group action and the elements that fix a point in the set, independent of the total number of elements in the group.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of the order of a group is not required to define or understand the concept of a stabilizer in the context of group actions on sets.",
