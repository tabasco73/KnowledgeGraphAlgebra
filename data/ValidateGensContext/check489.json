                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Field is necessary for the definition of a Simple Field Extension to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a Simple Field Extension. The definition states that a field extension $K \\subset L$ is called simple if there exists an element $\\alpha \\in L$ such that $L=K(\\alpha)$. This definition inherently involves two sets, $K$ and $L$, which are implied to be fields because they are part of a field extension. A field extension is a concept that cannot exist without the underlying concept of fields, as it specifically refers to an extension from one field to another. Therefore, understanding what a field is (a commutative division ring) is crucial to comprehending what it means for one field to be an extension of another and what properties such as commutativity and the existence of multiplicative inverses imply in the context of $K$ and $L$. Without the concept of a field, the notion of a field extension, and consequently the concept of a Simple Field Extension, would not have a meaningful or coherent foundation.",
