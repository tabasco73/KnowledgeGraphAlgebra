                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Commutative Ring is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic subset, we need to analyze the components of the definition of an Algebraic subset. The definition of an Algebraic subset involves the polynomial ring K[X]=K[X_1, ..., X_n], which is a ring of polynomials with coefficients in the field K. A polynomial ring, by its nature, is a commutative ring because the multiplication of polynomials is commutative. This inherent property of the polynomial ring being commutative is crucial because it ensures that the operations within the ring adhere to the commutative property, which is fundamental in many algebraic manipulations and theorems used in the study of algebraic subsets. Therefore, the concept of a Commutative Ring is implicitly required in the definition of an Algebraic subset because the polynomial ring, a key component in the definition, is a commutative ring.",
