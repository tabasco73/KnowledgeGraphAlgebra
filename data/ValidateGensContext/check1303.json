                "Explanation": "The concept of Disjoint Cycles involves two cycles being disjoint if the sets of elements in each cycle have no elements in common. This definition focuses solely on the elements within each cycle and their membership in sets. It does not require any understanding of functions or mappings between sets, which is what the Image of Map concept involves. The Image of Map pertains to the relationship between elements of two sets defined by a function, which is unrelated to the concept of whether two cycles in a permutation or any other structure are disjoint. Therefore, understanding or defining the Image of Map is not necessary for understanding or defining Disjoint Cycles.",
