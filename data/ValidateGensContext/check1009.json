(ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$.

                "Explanation": "The concept of a Group is defined independently of the concept of an A-module. A Group is a set with a binary operation that satisfies three properties: associativity, identity, and inverses. This definition is self-contained and does not require any external structures or concepts such as modules or rings.\\n\\nOn the other hand, an A-module involves a group (specifically an abelian group) and an additional structure of scalar multiplication by elements of a ring A. The definition of an A-module extends the concept of a group by incorporating operations with elements from a ring, but it is not necessary for the basic definition of a group.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a Group does not depend on the concept of an A-module. The existence and properties of groups can be fully understood without reference to modules or any additional algebraic structures.",
