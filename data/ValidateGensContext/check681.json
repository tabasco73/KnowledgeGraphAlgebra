                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for defining the 'Product of Ideals', we need to analyze the definition of the 'Product of Ideals'. The definition states that the product of two ideals, \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{b}\\), in a ring \\(R\\) is the set of all sums of the form \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{<\\infty} a_{i} b_{i}\\), where each \\(a_{i}\\) is an element of \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) and each \\(b_{i}\\) is an element of \\(\\mathfrak{b}\\). This definition inherently relies on the concept of 'elements' of the sets \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{b}\\), as it specifies that \\(a_{i}\\) and \\(b_{i}\\) must be elements of these sets. Without understanding what it means for something to be an 'element of a set', one cannot properly grasp the definition of the product of ideals, because the formation of such a product directly involves combining elements from these sets. Therefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is essential for the definition of a 'Product of Ideals' to make sense.",
