                "Explanation": "The definition of a Law of Composition explicitly mentions that it is a map from $M \\times M$ to $M$, where $M$ is a set. This implies that the concept of a set is integral to the definition of a Law of Composition because without a set $M$, the pairs $(a, b)$ and the mapping to elements within $M$ cannot be defined. Therefore, the concept of a set must be established first to provide the structure within which the Law of Composition operates. Without a set, there would be no defined domain or codomain for the mapping, making the concept of a Law of Composition inapplicable.",
