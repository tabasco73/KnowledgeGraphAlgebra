                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Field is necessary for defining the Degree of a Field Extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of the Degree of a Field Extension involves a field extension, which is a pair of fields $K$ and $L$ where $K \\subset L$. This implies that both $K$ and $L$ must be fields.\\n\\n2. The degree of the field extension is defined as the dimension of $L$ as a vector space over $K$. This concept inherently requires that $K$ and $L$ are fields because the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication in the vector space are defined based on the field properties of $K$.\\n\\n3. The definition of a Field as a commutative division ring is crucial because it establishes the algebraic structure necessary for $K$ and $L$ to support the operations of addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication required in the definition of vector spaces and, by extension, field extensions.\\n\\nTherefore, without the concept of a Field, the definition of the Degree of a Field Extension would not make sense because it relies on the properties and operations that are defined within the context of fields.",
