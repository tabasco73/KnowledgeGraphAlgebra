(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a ring explicitly states that it is a set R with two laws of composition: addition and multiplication. For addition, R must be a commutative group, which inherently includes the existence of an additive identity (zero element). For multiplication, the definition specifies that R must be a monoid. A monoid, by definition, requires the existence of a unit element (neutral element) with respect to multiplication. This unit element must satisfy the condition that multiplying it by any element of the set results in that element itself, which aligns with the definition of a unit or neutral element. Therefore, the concept of a unit or neutral element is essential for the definition of a ring, as it is part of the requirement that R be a monoid with respect to multiplication.",
