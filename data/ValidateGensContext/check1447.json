                "Explanation": "The definition of an Orbit inherently relies on the concept of a Group Action. According to the provided definition, the orbit of a point $x$ in a set $X$ under the action of a group $G$ is defined as $Gx = \\{gx; g \\in G\\}$. This definition presupposes that there is a function mapping elements of the group $G$ and the set $X$ to $X$, which is precisely what a Group Action is. The Group Action defines how elements of the group $G$ interact with elements of the set $X$, and without this definition, the concept of an orbit would not have a meaningful or functional context. Therefore, the concept of a Group Action is necessary for the definition of an Orbit to make sense.",
