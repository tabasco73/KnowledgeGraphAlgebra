                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Set is necessary for defining the Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Field, we need to analyze the components of the definition of the Galois Group:\\n\\n1. **Splitting Field**: This is a field that contains all the roots of a polynomial. A field is a set equipped with two operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain axioms. Therefore, the concept of a set is inherent in the definition of a field.\\n\\n2. **Automorphisms**: These are mappings from the field to itself that preserve the field structure. The set of all such automorphisms forms a group, specifically a group of functions. The concept of a function is fundamentally tied to the concept of sets, as a function is defined as a special kind of relation between sets (domain and codomain).\\n\\n3. **Permutation of Roots**: Permuting the roots of a polynomial involves rearranging these roots. The roots themselves form a set, and permutations are bijective functions from this set to itself.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of a set is crucial in defining the elements involved in the Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Field. Without the concept of sets, we cannot define fields, functions, or permutations, all of which are essential in the definition of the Galois Group.",
