                "Explanation": "The concept of a monoid involves a set with an associative binary operation and a unit element. A group, by definition, is a set with an associative binary operation, a unit element, and the additional property that every element has an inverse. Thus, every group is inherently a monoid, but the definition of a group includes more properties than those of a monoid.\\n\\nThe order of a group is defined solely based on the number of elements in the group, regardless of the group's structure beyond its basic definition as a set. The definition of the order of a group does not require the full structure of a monoid; it only requires the concept of a set and its cardinality. Therefore, understanding or defining a monoid is not necessary for the concept of the order of a group to make sense. The order of a group is independent of the additional properties that define a monoid beyond being a set.",
