                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic closure of a field, we need to analyze the components of each definition and their interdependencies.\\n\\n1. **Algebraic Closure of a Field**: This concept involves an extension field that is both algebraically closed and algebraic over the base field $K$. This means every non-constant polynomial in the field $K$ has a root in this extension field, and every element of the extension field is a root of some non-constant polynomial with coefficients in $K$.\\n\\n2. **Law of Composition**: This concept defines a binary operation on a set, which is essential for defining the structure of a field. A field is not just a set; it has two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that follow specific axioms (associativity, commutativity, distributivity, existence of identity and inverses).\\n\\n3. **Interdependency**: For a field to exist, and hence for an algebraic closure of a field to be defined, the field must have defined operations of addition and multiplication. These operations are examples of laws of composition. Without these operations, the set does not qualify as a field, and thus the concept of an algebraic closure, which relies on the field structure, cannot be established.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic closure of a field because it underpins the very structure of a field on which the definition of algebraic closure relies.",
