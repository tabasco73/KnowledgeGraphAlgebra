An algebraic field extension \\\\(K \\subset L\\\\) is called normal if it satisfies the equivalent conditions of Theorem 4: (i) Every \\\\(K\\\\)-homomorphism \\\\(L \\longrightarrow \\bar{L}\\\\) into an algebraic closure \\\\(\\bar{L}\\\\) of \\\\(L\\\\) restricts to an automorphism of \\\\(L\\\\). (ii) \\\\(L\\\\) is a splitting field of a family of polynomials in \\\\(K[X]\\\\).

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Galois extension explicitly states that it is an extension that is both normal and separable. This means that for an extension to be considered Galois, it must first satisfy the conditions of being a normal extension. The concept of a normal field extension is therefore integral to understanding and defining what a Galois extension is. Without the concept of a normal field extension, one cannot fully define or understand a Galois extension because the normality condition is a part of its definition. Thus, the concept of a normal field extension is necessary for the definition of a Galois extension to make sense.",
