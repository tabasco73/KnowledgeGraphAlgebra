            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of the Greatest common divisor (GCD) involves elements from a ring $R$ and focuses on divisibility properties within that ring. The definition requires that the GCD divides each of the elements in a set and that any other common divisor of these elements must also divide the GCD. This definition is concerned with the arithmetic properties of divisibility, common divisors, and containment relationships within the divisors of elements.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Group involves a set with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element, and where every element has an inverse. This definition focuses on the structure of the set and the interactions between its elements under the operation, emphasizing aspects like associativity, identity, and invertibility.\\n\\nThe concept of a GCD does not require the elements to have inverses or to be associative under some operation, as required in the definition of a Group. The properties needed to define a GCD are related to divisibility within a ring, not to the group-theoretic properties of elements having inverses or an associative operation. Therefore, the concept of a Group is not necessary to define a GCD.",
