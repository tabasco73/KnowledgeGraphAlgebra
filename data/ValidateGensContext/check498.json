This concept inherently deals with fields and their extensions.\\n\\nThe concept of a Zero Divisor pertains to rings where there exists an element that can multiply with another non-zero element to yield zero. Importantly, in fields, which are a special kind of ring, there are no zero divisors other than the trivial case of zero itself. This is because every non-zero element in a field has a multiplicative inverse, ensuring that no non-zero product can result in zero.\\n\\nGiven that the concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension deals exclusively with fields and field extensions, and considering that fields do not have zero divisors (other than zero), the concept of zero divisors is irrelevant and unnecessary for understanding or defining a Finitely Generated Field Extension. The properties and structure of fields suffice to support the definition and understanding of finitely generated field extensions without any need to reference zero divisors.",
