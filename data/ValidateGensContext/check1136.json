A maximal ideal is defined as a proper ideal in a ring R such that there is no other ideal between it and the ring R itself. This definition applies to any ring, whether it is commutative or not. Therefore, the concept of a commutative ring is not necessary for the definition of a maximal ideal to make sense. The concept of a maximal ideal is applicable in both commutative and non-commutative rings.",
