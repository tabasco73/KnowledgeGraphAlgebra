A homomorphism between two $A$-algebras $B$ and $C$ is a ring homomorphism $B \\longrightarrow C$ that is compatible with the defining homomorphisms $A \\longrightarrow B$ and $A \\longrightarrow C$, ensuring the commutativity of the diagram involving these maps."

                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Monomorphism is defined independently of the concept of an Algebra over a Ring. A Ring Monomorphism is simply a ring homomorphism that is injective, focusing solely on the properties of the ring homomorphism itself between two rings, without any additional structure or requirements involving a base ring as in the case of an Algebra over a Ring.\\n\\nOn the other hand, an Algebra over a Ring involves a ring homomorphism from a base ring to another ring, but this is a broader concept that introduces additional structure and relationships involving a base ring. The definition of a Ring Monomorphism does not require this additional structure and is complete with the properties of ring homomorphisms alone.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a Ring Monomorphism does not depend on or require the concept of an Algebra over a Ring. It is a more fundamental concept in ring theory that can be understood and applied without reference to the additional complexities of algebras over rings.",
