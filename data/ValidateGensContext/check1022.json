            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of 'Units of a Ring' explicitly refers to a 'ring R' and describes units as the multiplicatively invertible elements within this ring. This implies that the concept of a ring must be established first, as it provides the structure and properties (such as multiplication being associative and the existence of a unit element) that are essential for defining what it means for an element to be multiplicatively invertible. Without the concept of a ring, the definition of units of a ring would lack context and necessary properties, making it incoherent. Therefore, the concept of a ring is necessary for the concept of units of a ring to make sense.",
