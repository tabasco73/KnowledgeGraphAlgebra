                "Explanation": "The concept of a Dihedral Group involves the group of symmetries of a regular polygon, which includes operations such as rotations and reflections. These operations are represented by permutations. The group is defined by specific generators and the relations between them, which include the order of the rotations and how reflections interact with rotations.\\n\\nThe Commutative Law states that a binary operation is commutative if the order of the operands does not affect the result. In the context of group theory, this would mean that the group is abelian if it satisfies the commutative law.\\n\\nHowever, the dihedral group $D_n$ is generally not commutative (or abelian) for $n \\geq 3$. This is because the operation of applying a rotation followed by a reflection generally does not yield the same result as applying a reflection followed by a rotation. Therefore, the dihedral group does not inherently satisfy the commutative law.\\n\\nThus, the definition of a dihedral group does not depend on the concept of the commutative law. The dihedral group can be fully defined and understood without reference to whether its operations are commutative. The group's structure and properties can be described without needing the commutative law to be defined.",
