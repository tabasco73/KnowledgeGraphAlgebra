                "Explanation": "The concept of an Extension Field is fundamental to the definition of the Galois group of a Field Extension. The definition of the Galois group explicitly mentions an 'extension $L / K$', which implies that $L$ is an extension field of $K$. Without the concept of an extension field, the notion of automorphisms that fix every element of a base field $K$ while operating on an extended field $L$ would not make sense. Therefore, understanding what an extension field is, is crucial to defining and understanding the Galois group of that extension. The definition of an extension field provided, although specific to finite fields, illustrates the general concept of one field being an extension of another, which is necessary for the concept of a Galois group.",
