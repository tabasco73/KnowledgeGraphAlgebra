                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Ring Endomorphism is necessary for the definition of a Ring Automorphism, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts based on their definitions.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Ring Endomorphism**: An endomorphism of a ring $R$ is a homomorphism $\\\\(\\varphi: R \\longrightarrow R\\\\)$. This means that $\\\\(\\varphi\\\\)$ is a function from the ring $R$ to itself that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication).\\n\\n2. **Definition of Ring Automorphism**: An automorphism of a ring $R$ is an isomorphism $\\\\(\\varphi: R \\longrightarrow R\\\\)$. An isomorphism is a special kind of homomorphism that is bijective (one-to-one and onto).\\n\\n3. **Relationship between Endomorphism and Automorphism**: From the definitions, every automorphism is inherently an endomorphism because it is a homomorphism from $R$ to $R$. However, not every endomorphism is an automorphism because it may not be bijective.\\n\\n4. **Necessity of the Concept of Endomorphism**: The concept of an endomorphism provides the foundational idea of a homomorphism restricted to the same structure (in this case, the ring $R$). Understanding and defining an automorphism inherently relies on the concept of an endomorphism, as every automorphism is a bijective endomorphism. Therefore, the concept of an endomorphism is necessary to fully understand and define what an automorphism is, as it establishes the basic framework of mappings within the same structure before adding the condition of bijectivity.",
