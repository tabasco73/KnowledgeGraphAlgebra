Torsion elements are those elements x in M for which there exists a non-zero element a in A such that a*x = 0. Here, the operation a*x represents the action of A on M, which is a fundamental aspect of the module structure.\\n\\nThis operation (a*x) can be viewed as a function from A x M to M, where (a, x) maps to a*x. Thus, understanding and defining this operation requires the concept of a function or map, as it is a specific type of mapping from pairs of elements (from A and M) to elements in M.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Map/Function is necessary to properly define and understand the operation within the context of modules, and hence, is essential for defining what constitutes a torsion element and thus a Torsion submodule.",
