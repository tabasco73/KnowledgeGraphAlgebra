                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension is necessary for the definition of a Galois extension, we need to analyze the requirements of each concept:\\n\\n1. **Galois Extension**: The definition provided states that an extension $K_r / K$ is Galois if it is both normal and separable. This definition focuses on the algebraic properties of the extension, specifically its behavior with respect to polynomial roots and separability of elements over the base field.\\n\\n2. **Finitely Generated Field Extension**: This concept describes a field extension $K \\subset L$ that can be generated by a finite number of elements from $L$. This is a structural property about how the extension is generated or constructed from the base field $K$.\\n\\nThe definition of a Galois extension does not inherently require that the extension be finitely generated. A Galois extension can exist whether or not it is finitely generated. The key properties for a Galois extension are normality and separability, which are independent of how many elements are needed to generate the extension field.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension is not necessary for the definition of a Galois extension to make sense. The two concepts address different aspects of field extensions: one deals with algebraic properties (Galois) and the other with the method of generation (Finitely Generated).",
