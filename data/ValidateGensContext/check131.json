                "Explanation": "The concept of a Solvable group is defined purely within the context of group theory. It involves a sequence of subgroups and the property of each quotient being abelian, which relates to the structure and properties of groups. On the other hand, a Principal Ideal Domain (PID) is a concept from ring theory, specifically a type of ring where every ideal is generated by a single element. The definition of a PID involves ideals and elements of a ring, which are unrelated to the group-theoretic properties used to define a solvable group. There is no inherent connection or dependency between the structure of groups (as in solvable groups) and the structure of rings (as in PIDs). Therefore, understanding or defining a solvable group does not require the concept of a PID.",
