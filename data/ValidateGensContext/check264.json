                "Explanation": "The definition of an Integral Domain explicitly states that it is a commutative ring. A commutative ring, by definition, is a ring in which the multiplication operation is commutative. This means that for any two elements a and b in the ring, the product ab equals ba, adhering to the Commutative Law. Therefore, the concept of the Commutative Law is inherently required and used in defining what a commutative ring is, and subsequently, what an Integral Domain is. Without the Commutative Law, the notion of a commutative ring, and thus an Integral Domain, would not be properly defined or understood.",
