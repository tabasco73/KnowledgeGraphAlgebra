                "Explanation": "The concept of the Center of a group is defined as the set of all elements in a group $G$ that commute with every other element in $G$. This definition is self-contained and does not inherently require the concept of a Symmetric Group. The Center can be defined for any group, regardless of whether that group is symmetric or not. The Symmetric Group is a specific type of group, one of many possible groups, and is not necessary to understand or define the concept of the Center of a group. The definition of the Center is applicable to any group, including but not limited to Symmetric Groups. Therefore, the concept of a Symmetric Group is not needed to define or understand the concept of the Center of a group.",
