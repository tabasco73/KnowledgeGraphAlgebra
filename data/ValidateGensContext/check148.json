                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Isomorphism involves a bijective ring homomorphism that has an inverse which is also a ring homomorphism. This definition requires the homomorphism to be both surjective (onto) and injective (one-to-one), ensuring that every element in the target ring corresponds to exactly one element in the source ring, and vice versa.\\n\\nOn the other hand, an Integral Ring Homomorphism involves a condition where every element of the target ring B is integral over the source ring A. This concept is related to the algebraic dependencies of elements in B over A, and does not inherently involve the bijectiveness or the existence of an inverse homomorphism.\\n\\nThus, the definition of a Ring Isomorphism does not depend on the concept of an Integral Ring Homomorphism. The two concepts operate independently in the context of ring theory. A Ring Isomorphism focuses on the structural and functional correspondence between two rings, while an Integral Ring Homomorphism focuses on the algebraic properties of elements with respect to their pre-images.",
