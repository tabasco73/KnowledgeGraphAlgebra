                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Subgroup generated by a set, we need to analyze the components of each definition.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Subgroup generated by a set involves the concept of a group $G$ and a subset $X \\\\$subset G$. The subgroup $H$ generated by $X$ is described as consisting of all elements that can be expressed in the form $x_{1}^{\\\\varepsilon_{1}} \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot x_{n}^{\\\\varepsilon_{n}}$, where $x_{1}, \\\\ldots, x_{n} \\\\$in X$ and $\\\\varepsilon_{1}, \\\\ldots, \\\\varepsilon_{n} \\\\$in \\\\{1,-1\\\\}$, and $n$ varies over $\\\\mathbb{N}$. This expression clearly involves the operation of multiplication (or composition) within the group.\\n\\n2. The Law of Composition is defined as a map from $M \\\\times M$ to $M$ that assigns a product to each pair of elements in $M$. This is exactly the type of operation used in the definition of a subgroup generated by a set, where elements of $X$ are combined using the group's operation (composition).\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is evident that the concept of a Law of Composition is integral to the definition of a Subgroup generated by a set. The operation (or law of composition) within the group $G$ is necessary to form combinations of elements from $X$ as specified in the definition of the subgroup generated by $X$. Without a defined operation on the group, it would not be possible to discuss the formation of such a subgroup.",
