                "Explanation": "To understand the dihedral group $D_n$, it is essential to comprehend the concept of permutations, which are specific types of functions or maps. In the definition of $D_n$, the group is generated by permutations $\\\\(\\sigma\\\\)$ and $\\\\(\\tau\\\\)$. These permutations are functions that map elements of the set $\\\\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\\\)$ to other elements within the same set, adhering to certain rules (in this case, representing rotations and reflections of the vertices of an $n$-gon).\\n\\nA map or function, by definition, is a relationship that associates every element of one set (domain) to exactly one element of another set (codomain). In the context of the dihedral group, $\\\\(\\sigma\\\\)$ and $\\\\(\\tau\\\\)$ are such maps, as they each take every vertex of the $n$-gon (elements of their domain) and associate them uniquely to other vertices (elements of their codomain).\\n\\nTherefore, understanding the concept of a map or function is crucial for defining the dihedral group, as the operations that generate the group are themselves maps. Without the concept of a map or function, the definition of permutations and thus the structure of the dihedral group would not be comprehensible.",
