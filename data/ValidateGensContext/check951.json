            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of a Polynomial Ring, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Polynomial Ring involves a commutative ring R. A ring, by definition, is a set equipped with two binary operations: addition and multiplication. These operations must satisfy certain properties, including the existence of an additive identity and additive inverses, making the set of elements under addition a group (specifically, an abelian group).\\n\\n2. Therefore, understanding the structure of a ring inherently involves understanding the concept of a group, at least with respect to addition. The group properties ensure that every element in the ring has an additive inverse and that addition is associative and commutative.\\n\\n3. Since a Polynomial Ring is defined based on a ring, and understanding a ring requires understanding the properties of a group (at least under addition), the concept of a group is indeed necessary to fully grasp what constitutes a Polynomial Ring.\\n\\n4. Thus, the concept of a Group is needed to properly define and understand the structure and operations within a Polynomial Ring.",
