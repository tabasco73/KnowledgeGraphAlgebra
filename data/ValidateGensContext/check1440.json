The definition of the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field explicitly references a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. It states that this group is formed by all nonzero elements of $\\mathbb{F}_q$, denoted as $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$.\\n\\n2. The properties and existence of $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$ are directly dependent on the properties of $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Without $\\mathbb{F}_q$, there are no elements to form $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$.\\n\\n3. The definition of a Finite Field provides the necessary context and structure (such as the number of elements and the nature of these elements) for understanding what $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is and how it behaves.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of a Finite Field, the definition of its Multiplicative Group would lack a foundational basis, making it incomplete and not understandable.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Finite Field is essential for the definition of the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field to be meaningful and coherent.",
