                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a commutative ring is necessary for the definition of a splitting field of a polynomial, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a splitting field involves a polynomial $f$ with coefficients in a field $K$. A field $K$ is a special type of ring, specifically a commutative ring with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.\\n\\n2. The definition of a splitting field does not explicitly require the concept of a commutative ring, but it inherently relies on the structure of a field, which is a subset of commutative rings. Therefore, understanding fields (as used in the definition of a splitting field) implicitly requires understanding that fields are commutative rings.\\n\\n3. However, the specific properties of commutative rings that distinguish them from non-commutative rings (i.e., the commutativity of multiplication) are not directly invoked in the definition of a splitting field. The essential property used is that of a field being a ring (not necessarily commutative) where every non-zero element has an inverse.\\n\\n4. Thus, while the concept of a commutative ring underlies the concept of a field, it is not explicitly necessary for the definition of a splitting field. The critical aspect is the field structure, particularly the existence of inverses for non-zero elements, rather than the commutativity of the ring itself.",
