The definition states that a Dedekind domain is an integral domain in which the theorem on unique prime factorization holds for ideals. This implies that the concept of ideals is integral to understanding what a Dedekind domain is, as the unique factorization is specifically applied to ideals, not just elements of the domain.\\n\\nSince the definition of a Dedekind Domain explicitly involves the behavior and properties of ideals (specifically their unique prime factorization), understanding what an ideal is becomes necessary. Without knowing what an ideal is, one cannot fully grasp the meaning of unique prime factorization of ideals, which is a central aspect of the definition of a Dedekind Domain. Therefore, the concept of an Ideal must be defined and understood first to make sense of what a Dedekind Domain is.",
