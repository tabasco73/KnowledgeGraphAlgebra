                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of an 'Extension Field' to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of an Extension Field:\\n\\n1. An extension field $[\\mathbb{F}_q / \\mathbb{F}_p]$ is described as a field consisting of $q=p^n$ elements. Here, the term 'elements' directly refers to the objects that belong to the set that forms the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Without understanding what an 'element' is, one cannot comprehend what it means for a field to consist of a certain number of elements.\\n\\n2. The field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is defined over another field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, and the relationship between these fields involves the elements of both fields. Understanding the interaction between elements of different sets (fields, in this case) is crucial for grasping the concept of field extensions.\\n\\n3. The definition also involves the polynomial $X^q - X$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$, which implies operations on elements of $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and considerations of how these elements behave under polynomial functions.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is fundamental to understanding what a field is, how it is structured, and how it functions. Without this basic concept, the definition of an extension field would lack clarity and coherence, as the notion of a field consisting of elements would be undefined.",
