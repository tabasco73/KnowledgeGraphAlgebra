                "Explanation": "The concept of a maximal ideal is defined within the context of ring theory and does not inherently require the ring to be a division ring. A maximal ideal is defined as a proper ideal in any ring R, such that there is no other ideal between this ideal and the ring itself. This definition applies to any ring, whether it is a division ring, a commutative ring, or any other type of ring.\\n\\nA division ring, on the other hand, is a specific type of ring where every nonzero element is invertible. This property of being a division ring affects the structure and properties of the ring but does not influence the definition of what constitutes a maximal ideal. The definition of a maximal ideal only requires the structure of a ring (associative, with identity, and additive inverses) and does not depend on all elements being invertible, as in a division ring.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a division ring is not necessary for the definition of a maximal ideal to make sense. The definition of maximal ideal is applicable to any ring, regardless of whether it is a division ring or not.",
