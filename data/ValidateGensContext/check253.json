(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Ring includes the requirement that the set R is a commutative group with respect to addition, which means that addition must be commutative (i.e., a + b = b + a for all a, b in R). However, the definition does not require that multiplication be commutative. The Commutative Law as a concept specifically refers to the property where a binary operation is commutative on a set. In the context of defining a Ring, the Commutative Law is explicitly needed for the addition operation but not necessarily for the multiplication operation. Therefore, the concept of the Commutative Law is partially needed for the definition of a Ring, specifically for ensuring that the addition operation is commutative as per the requirements of a commutative group.",
