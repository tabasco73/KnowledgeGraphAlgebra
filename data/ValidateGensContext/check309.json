                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Commutative Ring is necessary for the definition of a Factor Ring to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Factor Ring involves a ring $R$ and an ideal $\\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\)$ in $R$. The factor ring $R / \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\)$ is defined using the ring operations of addition and multiplication, where these operations are defined modulo the ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Factor Ring does not specify that the ring $R$ must be commutative. It only requires $R$ to be a ring and $\\mathfrak{a}$ to be an ideal in $R$. The operations in the factor ring $R / \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\)$ are well-defined regardless of whether $R$ is commutative or not.\\n\\n3. The concept of a Commutative Ring specifically refers to rings where the multiplication operation is commutative. This is an additional property that a ring might have, but it is not a prerequisite for the existence or definition of a ring or an ideal within that ring.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the definition of a Factor Ring can be applied to any ring, whether it is commutative or not. The commutativity of the ring $R$ does not affect the basic structure or the definition of a factor ring $R / \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\)$.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Commutative Ring is not necessary for the definition of a Factor Ring to make sense. The essential requirements are that $R$ is a ring and $\\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal in $R$.",
