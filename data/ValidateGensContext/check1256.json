                "Explanation": "The definition of the Cartesian Product explicitly mentions and uses the concept of a set. It states that $M$ must be a set and that the Cartesian product $M \\times M$ is the set of all ordered pairs from $M$. This implies that the concept of a set is fundamental to understanding and defining the Cartesian product, as it relies on the notion of a collection of elements (a set) and the resultant collection of ordered pairs, which is also treated as a set. Without the concept of a set, the definition of a Cartesian product would lack the necessary structure and context, making it incoherent.",
