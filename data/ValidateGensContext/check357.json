This definition is purely algebraic and does not inherently require any specific properties of the ring R beyond the basic ring structure and the concept of ideals.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Noetherian ring is defined by a property concerning the behavior of chains of ideals within the ring, specifically that every ascending chain of ideals eventually stabilizes, or that every ideal is finitely generated. This property is about the structure and behavior of ideals in a broader sense within the ring.\\n\\nThe definition of the product of ideals does not depend on whether the ring is Noetherian or not. The concept of a Noetherian ring introduces additional conditions on the behavior of ideals, but it is not necessary for the basic algebraic operation of forming the product of two ideals. The product of ideals can be defined and understood in any ring, regardless of whether it is Noetherian.",
