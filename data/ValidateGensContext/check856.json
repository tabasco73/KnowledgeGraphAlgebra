                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a subset is necessary for defining the units of a ring, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts. The definition of 'Units of a Ring' states that for a ring R, the set of multiplicatively invertible elements is denoted by R*. These elements are called the units of R. This definition inherently involves the concept of a subset because R* (the set of units) is composed of certain elements from the ring R that satisfy a specific property (being multiplicatively invertible). Therefore, R* is a subset of R since every element in R* is also an element of R. Without the concept of a subset, the notion that R* is a part of R, containing only some of R's elements, would not be clearly expressible or understood. Thus, the concept of a subset is integral to defining what the units of a ring are, as it provides the framework to understand that R* is a specific, contained selection of elements from the larger set R.",
