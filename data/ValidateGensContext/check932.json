                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Simple Field Extension is necessary for the definition of a Normal Field Extension to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions and dependencies between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Normal Field Extension**: This definition involves the concept of a field extension being a splitting field for a family of polynomials from the base field. It also involves the behavior of homomorphisms and the decomposition of polynomials.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Simple Field Extension**: This concept describes a field extension generated by a single element. It specifies that the entire extension field can be expressed as a function of one element from the extension.\\n\\n3. **Analysis of Dependency**: The definition of a Normal Field Extension does not explicitly require the extension to be generated by a single element, nor does it rely on the concept of generating an extension field from one element. It focuses on the properties of polynomials and their roots in the extension field.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the definition of a Normal Field Extension is concerned with the splitting of polynomials and the behavior of homomorphisms, and does not inherently require the extension to be simple (i.e., generated by one element), the concept of a Simple Field Extension is not necessary for the definition of a Normal Field Extension to make sense.",
