                "Explanation": "The definition of an Empty Product explicitly references the concept of a monoid. It states that in a monoid, the empty product is defined as the unit element, denoted as $e$. This implies that the concept of a monoid, which includes a set with an associative law of composition and a unit element, is essential for defining what an empty product is. Without the structure of a monoid, the notion of a unit element, which is central to the definition of an empty product, would not exist. Therefore, the concept of a monoid is necessary for the definition of an empty product to make sense.",
