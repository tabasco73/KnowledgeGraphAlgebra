(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The concept of a Cycle as defined pertains to permutations within the symmetric group \\\\(\\textbackslash mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\), which is a group of all permutations of a set of n elements. The definition of a Cycle involves the arrangement of elements in a specific sequence where each element maps to another in a closed loop, and all other elements map to themselves.\\n\\nThe concept of a Ring, on the other hand, involves a set equipped with two binary operations: addition and multiplication, satisfying certain properties like associativity, commutativity of addition, and distributivity of multiplication over addition.\\n\\nThese two concepts operate in fundamentally different mathematical structures and domains. The definition of a Cycle is purely within the context of group theory, specifically dealing with permutations and their properties. It does not require or imply the algebraic structure of a Ring, which deals with operations like addition and multiplication.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a Cycle do not depend on the concept of a Ring. They are independent mathematical concepts with no inherent dependency for their definitions or understanding.",
