                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a prime subfield is necessary for defining a splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Prime Subfield Definition**: The prime subfield of a field $K$ is the smallest subfield contained within $K$. It is unique and is either isomorphic to the field of rational numbers $\\\\mathbb{Q}$ (in characteristic zero) or a finite field $\\\\mathbb{F}_p$ (in positive characteristic $p$).\\n\\n2. **Splitting Field Definition**: A splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield $\\\\mathbb{F}_p$ is a field in which the polynomial $X^q-X$ completely factorizes into linear factors. This field contains all the roots of the polynomial.\\n\\n3. **Necessity of Prime Subfield**: The definition of the splitting field explicitly references the prime subfield $\\\\mathbb{F}_p$. The prime subfield provides the base field over which the polynomial $X^q-X$ is considered. Without defining the prime subfield, it would be unclear over which field the polynomial is defined and needs to split. Thus, the concept of the prime subfield is essential to establish the ground field over which the polynomial's behavior (splitting into linear factors) is analyzed.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the definition of the splitting field of $X^q-X$ relies on the concept of its prime subfield to specify the field over which the polynomial is defined and splits, the concept of the prime subfield is indeed necessary for the definition of the splitting field to make sense.",
