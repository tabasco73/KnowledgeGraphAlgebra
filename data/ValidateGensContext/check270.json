                "Explanation": "The concept of an algebraic closure of a field involves the field being algebraically closed and every element of the closure being algebraic over the original field. This concept inherently relies on the properties of fields, which include the commutative law of addition and multiplication. Specifically, for any field, and thus for any algebraic closure of a field, it is required that the multiplication operation be commutative, i.e., $ab = ba$ for all $a, b$ in the field.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of an algebraic closure of a field implicitly assume the commutative property of multiplication (and addition) as part of the field structure. Without the commutative law, the structure would not meet the definition of a field, and thus the concept of an algebraic closure of a non-field (where commutative law might not hold) does not make sense. Hence, the commutative law needs to be defined and understood for the concept of an algebraic closure of a field to be meaningful and applicable.",
