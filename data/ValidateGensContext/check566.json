                "Explanation": "A ring automorphism is defined as an isomorphism from a ring $R$ to itself. This definition inherently requires the existence of a single ring $R$ and a function $\\\\$varphi: R \\\\longrightarrow R\\\\$$ that is both a homomorphism and bijective, meaning it preserves the ring operations and is one-to-one and onto.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a ring extension involves two rings, $S$ and $R$, where $S$ is a subring of $R$. This concept is used to study the properties of rings in relation to their subrings and does not directly relate to the structure or properties of a single ring as in the case of automorphisms.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a ring automorphism does not depend on the concept of a ring extension. The definition and understanding of a ring automorphism can be fully established without any reference to the concept of a ring extension.",
