                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Commutative Ring, we need to analyze the components of each definition.\\n\\n1. **Law of Composition**: This concept defines a binary operation on a set, mapping pairs of elements from the set to another element within the same set. It is essential for defining any algebraic structure where operations between elements are involved.\\n\\n2. **Commutative Ring**: The definition of a commutative ring involves the property that the ring's multiplication operation is commutative. This implies the existence of a multiplication operation, which is a specific type of law of composition.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of a law of composition is inherently required in the definition of a commutative ring. Without a law of composition, there would be no defined multiplication operation on the ring, and thus, the property of commutativity of this operation could not be discussed or established.",
