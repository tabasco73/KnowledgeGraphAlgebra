                "Explanation": "The concept of a prime element in a unique factorization domain (UFD) is defined independently of the concept of localization of a ring. A prime element $p$ in a UFD $R$ is defined based on its ability to generate a prime ideal $(p)$, which means that if $p$ divides a product of elements in $R$, then $p$ divides at least one of those elements. This definition relies solely on the properties of division and multiplication within the ring $R$ itself and does not require any consideration of fractions or elements outside of $R$. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of localization of a ring involves creating a new ring by allowing division by more elements than originally allowed in $R$. This process is useful for various purposes in ring theory and algebraic geometry, but it is not necessary for defining what a prime element is in the original ring $R$. The definition of a prime element can be fully understood and applied without reference to the localization of the ring. Therefore, the concept of localization of a ring is not needed for the definition of a prime element to make sense.",
