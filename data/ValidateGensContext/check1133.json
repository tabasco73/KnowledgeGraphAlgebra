                "Explanation": "The definition of a submonoid involves a subset of a monoid that itself must satisfy the monoid properties: it must contain the identity element of the monoid and be closed under the monoid operation. This definition is self-contained and does not reference any external structures or mappings between different algebraic structures.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a group homomorphism involves a mapping between two monoids (or groups) that preserves the monoid (or group) operations. This concept is about the relationship between two different algebraic structures and how elements from one structure map to another while preserving the algebraic operations.\\n\\nGiven these definitions, the concept of a submonoid can be fully understood and utilized without any reference to or need for the concept of a group homomorphism. The definition of a submonoid is concerned solely with the properties of a subset within a single monoid, whereas a group homomorphism deals with the interactions between two distinct monoids or groups.",
