                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for defining a 'Torsion submodule', we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a 'Torsion submodule' involves the collection of all torsion elements of an A-module M. This implies that the torsion submodule is a subset of M, consisting of specific elements of M that meet certain criteria (being torsion elements).\\n\\n2. The concept of an 'Element of a Set' is fundamental in understanding what it means for something to be a part of a set. Without this concept, we cannot properly define what it means for an element to belong to M or to any subset of M, including the torsion submodule.\\n\\n3. Therefore, the definition of a 'Torsion submodule' inherently relies on the understanding that it is a set (or subset) composed of elements. These elements are defined as being part of the set M and satisfying the condition of being torsion elements.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of an 'Element of a Set', we would lack the basic framework to discuss membership in any set or subset, which is crucial for defining any kind of submodule, including a torsion submodule.",
