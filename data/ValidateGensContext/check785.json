                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Field Extension is necessary for defining a Galois group of a Field Extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Galois group of a Field Extension explicitly references a field extension $L / K$, where $L$ is an extension of $K$. The Galois group consists of all field automorphisms of $L$ that fix every element of $K$.\\n\\n2. The concept of a Field Extension is defined as a pair of fields $K \\subset L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This establishes the relationship and structure between $K$ and $L$ necessary for discussing properties like automorphisms that fix elements of $K$.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Field Extension provides the foundational context for the Galois group. Without understanding what a Field Extension is, one cannot meaningfully discuss the automorphisms of $L$ that fix $K$, as there would be no defined relationship between $K$ and $L$. Thus, the concept of a Field Extension is essential for the definition of a Galois group of a Field Extension to make sense.",
