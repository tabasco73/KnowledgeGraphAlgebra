                "Explanation": "The definition of a ring isomorphism explicitly relies on the concept of a ring homomorphism. A ring isomorphism is defined as a ring homomorphism that is bijective and has an inverse that is also a ring homomorphism. This means that without the concept of a ring homomorphism, the definition of a ring isomorphism would not make sense because it would be unclear what kind of function is being referred to, and what properties this function should have. Therefore, the concept of a ring homomorphism is essential and foundational for defining what a ring isomorphism is.",
