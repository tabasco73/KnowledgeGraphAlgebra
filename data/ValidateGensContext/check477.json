                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field of Fractions is specifically defined for integral domains, which are commutative rings with no zero divisors. The definition of a Field of Fractions involves creating a field from an integral domain by considering pairs (a, b) where a and b are elements of the integral domain and b is not zero. The pairs are treated as fractions a/b, and an equivalence relation is defined to handle the equality of fractions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Division Ring is a more general concept where every nonzero element is a unit, but the ring need not be commutative. The definition of a Division Ring does not inherently relate to the concept of an integral domain or the construction of a field of fractions from such a domain.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Division Ring is not necessary for the definition of a Field of Fractions. The Field of Fractions is specifically related to integral domains (which are a subset of commutative rings), and the properties of a Division Ring (non-commutativity and units for all nonzero elements) do not directly influence the definition or existence of a Field of Fractions.",
