                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension is necessary for defining an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field, we need to analyze the definitions and requirements of each concept.\\n\\n1. **Algebraic Closure of Finite Field**: This concept involves a field that contains a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and all its algebraic extensions. The algebraic closure is essentially the largest field containing all algebraic extensions of $\\mathbb{F}_p$, including infinite extensions.\\n\\n2. **Finitely Generated Field Extension**: This concept describes a field extension generated by a finite number of elements from a smaller field. It specifically pertains to extensions where you can list a finite set of generators.\\n\\nGiven these definitions, the concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension is not inherently necessary for defining an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field. The algebraic closure includes potentially infinite algebraic extensions, which go beyond the scope of being finitely generated. The definition of an algebraic closure does not rely on the field extension being finitely generated but rather on encompassing all algebraic extensions, regardless of their generation method.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension is not required to define an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field.",
