                "Explanation": "The concept of the degree of a field extension, as defined, involves the dimension of one field as a vector space over another field. This dimension is calculated purely in terms of vector space properties and does not inherently involve the characteristic of the field. The characteristic of a field, which is a measure of the smallest number of times the unit element must be added to itself to yield zero, affects the structure of the field but does not directly influence the definition or calculation of the degree of a field extension. The degree of a field extension is determined by the number of linearly independent vectors in the larger field when considered as a vector space over the smaller field, which is a concept independent of the characteristic. Therefore, understanding or defining the characteristic of a field is not necessary for the concept of the degree of a field extension to make sense.",
