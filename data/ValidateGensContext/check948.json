            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of an Orbit explicitly involves the action of a group $G$ on a set $X$. The orbit of a point $x$ in $X$ is defined as the set of all elements obtained by applying each element of the group $G$ to $x$. This definition inherently requires the concept of a group because it uses the group elements to define the orbit. Without understanding what a group is, and without a group to provide the elements for the action, the concept of an orbit cannot be established or understood. Therefore, the concept of a group is essential and foundational for defining the concept of an orbit.",
