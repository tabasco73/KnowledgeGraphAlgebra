                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Monomorphism is defined as an injective ring homomorphism from one ring R to another ring R'. This definition requires the understanding of rings and the concept of injective functions, but it does not specifically require the concept of a Polynomial Ring. A Polynomial Ring is a specific type of ring constructed from a given ring R, involving sequences that represent polynomials. While Polynomial Rings are examples of rings, the definition of a Ring Monomorphism does not depend on this specific example. It is a general concept applicable to any rings, not just polynomial rings. Therefore, the concept of a Polynomial Ring is not necessary for the definition of a Ring Monomorphism to make sense.",
