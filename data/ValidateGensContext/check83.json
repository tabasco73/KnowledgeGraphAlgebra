                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension is necessary for the definition of a Splitting Field of a Family of Polynomials, we need to analyze the requirements of each definition.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Splitting Field of a Family of Polynomials specifies that the field extension \\(L / K\\) must be generated by the zeros of the polynomials \\(f_i\\). This implies that there are specific elements (the zeros of the polynomials) in \\(L\\) such that \\(L\\) can be expressed as \\(K\\) adjoined with these zeros.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Finitely Generated Field Extension states that a field extension \\(K \\\\subset L\\) is finitely generated if there exist finitely many elements in \\(L\\) such that \\(L\\) equals \\(K\\) adjoined with these elements.\\n\\n3. The requirement in the definition of the Splitting Field that \\(L / K\\) is generated by the zeros of the polynomials aligns with the concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension, but it does not explicitly require that the number of such generating elements (zeros) be finite. Therefore, while the concept of being generated by elements is shared, the finiteness condition is not explicitly required in the definition of a Splitting Field.\\n\\n4. Thus, the concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension introduces an additional condition \u2014 the finiteness of the generating set \u2014 which is not necessary for the definition of a Splitting Field. The Splitting Field only requires that the extension be generated by the zeros, regardless of their number.",
