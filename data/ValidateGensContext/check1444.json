                "Explanation": "The definition of a reduced ideal involves the concept of the radical of an ideal, which is defined independently of whether the ring is Noetherian or not. The radical of an ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) in a ring \\\\(R\\\\) is the set of all elements \\\\(a \\\\in R\\\\) such that there exists some \\\\(n \\\\in \\mathbb{N}\\\\) with \\\\(a^{n} \\\\in \\mathfrak{a}\\\\). This definition does not require any properties related to the ascending chain condition or the finite generation of ideals, which are central to the definition of a Noetherian ring.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Noetherian ring is not necessary for the definition of a reduced ideal to make sense. The definition of a reduced ideal can be applied in any ring, regardless of whether it is Noetherian or not. The essential aspect of the definition of a reduced ideal is the relationship between an ideal and its radical, which is a concept that can be defined in any ring setting.",
