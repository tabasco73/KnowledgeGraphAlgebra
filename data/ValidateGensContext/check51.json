                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Normal Subgroup, we need to analyze the components of each definition.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Normal Subgroup involves the condition $aH = Ha$ for all $a \\n G$. This condition implies the existence of operations involving elements of the group $G$ and the subgroup $H$. Specifically, $aH$ and $Ha$ denote the sets $\\n a \\n h : h \\n H\\n$ and $\\n h \\n a : h \\n H\\n$ respectively. These operations are based on the group operation, which is a type of law of composition.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Law of Composition describes a binary operation on a set, which maps pairs of elements from the set to another element within the same set. In the context of groups, the group operation (e.g., multiplication or addition) is a law of composition.\\n\\n3. Since the definition of a normal subgroup inherently relies on the group operation to define the equality of left and right cosets, and since the group operation is a law of composition, it follows that the concept of a law of composition is essential for the definition of a normal subgroup to make sense. Without a law of composition, there would be no group operation, and thus the concept of left and right cosets, as well as their equality, would not be well-defined.",
