                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a separable extension is necessary for defining the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting field, we need to consider the properties of both concepts:\\n\\n1. **Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields**: This group consists of automorphisms of the splitting field that fix the base field and permute the roots of the polynomial. The splitting field is a field extension of the base field that contains all the roots of the polynomial.\\n\\n2. **Separable Extension**: This is an extension where every element is separable, meaning that the minimal polynomial of each element over the base field has distinct roots.\\n\\nThe connection between these two concepts lies in the nature of the extensions and the behavior of the roots. For a field extension to have a well-defined Galois group, it must be both normal (the splitting field is a normal extension because it contains all roots of the polynomial) and separable. If the extension is not separable, then some elements of the extension might have minimal polynomials over the base field that do not split completely into distinct linear factors in any extension, leading to issues with defining automorphisms that behave consistently across all conjugates of an element.\\n\\nThus, the concept of a separable extension is crucial in ensuring that every automorphism in the Galois group can be well-defined and that the group structure is consistent. Without separability, the definition of the Galois group might not hold as the automorphisms may not be able to permute all roots of the polynomial in a well-defined manner.",
