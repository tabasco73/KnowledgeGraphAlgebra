                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a commutative ring is necessary for defining an integral ring homomorphism, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. Integral Ring Homomorphism: This concept involves a ring homomorphism where every element of the target ring B is integral over the source ring A. The definition does not specify that the rings A or B must be commutative; it only requires that elements of B satisfy a certain polynomial equation with coefficients in A.\\n\\n2. Commutative Ring: This concept defines a ring where the multiplication operation is commutative.\\n\\nThe definition of an integral ring homomorphism does not inherently require that the rings involved be commutative. The essential requirement is that elements of B are roots of monic polynomials over A, which is a condition that can be met even if the rings are not commutative. Therefore, the concept of a commutative ring is not necessary for the definition of an integral ring homomorphism to make sense.",
