                "Explanation": "The definition of an r-cycle explicitly refers to a cycle involving a specific number of elements, r. This definition inherently relies on the concept of a cycle as it specifies a particular kind of cycle, one that involves exactly r elements. Without understanding what a cycle is in the context of permutations, the definition of an r-cycle would lack foundational meaning. The general concept of a cycle describes a permutation where a sequence of elements is rearranged cyclically, and other elements (if any) remain unchanged. This general concept is crucial to understanding what it means for a permutation to be an r-cycle, as the r-cycle is a specific instance or subset of the broader concept of cycles. Therefore, the concept of a cycle must be defined and understood first to make sense of what an r-cycle is, as the latter is a detailed extension of the former.",
