                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Isomorphism involves a ring homomorphism that is bijective and has an inverse that is also a ring homomorphism. A ring, by definition, includes an associative binary operation (addition) and another associative binary operation (multiplication) that also distributes over the addition. Therefore, the definition of a ring inherently includes the Associative Law for both addition and multiplication.\\n\\nFor a function to be a ring homomorphism, and thus for a ring isomorphism to exist, it must preserve these operations. This preservation implies that the operations in both the domain and codomain rings must be associative. Hence, the Associative Law is fundamental to the structure of rings and the definition of ring homomorphisms and isomorphisms.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of the Associative Law is necessary for the definition of a Ring Isomorphism to make sense, as it ensures that the basic operations within the rings follow the associative property, which is crucial for the operations being preserved under the isomorphism.",
