More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of a Sum of Ideals, we need to analyze the dependencies of the concepts involved.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Sum of Ideals involves ideals $\\\\frak{a}$ and $\\\\frak{b}$ in a ring $R$. The sum $\\\\frak{a}+\\\\frak{b}$ is defined as $\\\\text{{\\textbraceleft}}a+b ; a \\\\text{ in } \\\\frak{a}, b \\\\text{ in } \\\\frak{b}\\\\text{{\\textbraceright}}$.\\n\\n2. An ideal in a ring is a subset of the ring that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of the ring. A ring itself is a set equipped with two binary operations: addition and multiplication, where the addition operation forms an abelian group.\\n\\n3. The definition of a Group involves a set with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element, and every element has an inverse. Specifically, the addition operation in a ring forms an abelian group.\\n\\n4. Since the definition of an ideal inherently involves the concept of a ring, and since a ring's addition operation forms a group (specifically an abelian group), the concept of a Group is implicitly required to fully understand and define what an ideal is, and consequently, what the sum of two ideals is.\\n\\n5. Therefore, the concept of a Group is necessary to define the Sum of Ideals because the operations within the ideals (specifically addition, which forms a group) are fundamental to understanding how the sum of two ideals is constructed.",
