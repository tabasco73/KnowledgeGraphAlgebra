                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a commutative ring is necessary for the definition of a reduced ideal to make sense, we need to analyze the definition of a reduced ideal and see if it inherently requires the ring to be commutative.\\n\\nThe definition of a reduced ideal states that an ideal \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) in a ring \\(R\\) is reduced if \\(\\mathfrak{a} = \\operatorname{rad} \\mathfrak{a}\\), where \\(\\operatorname{rad} \\mathfrak{a}\\) includes elements \\(a \\in R\\) such that there exists some \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(a^n \\in \\mathfrak{a}\\). This definition involves the concept of an ideal and the radical of an ideal, but it does not explicitly require that the ring \\(R\\) be commutative. The operations and properties involved in defining the radical of an ideal and checking if an element's power belongs to the ideal do not depend on the commutativity of multiplication in the ring.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a reduced ideal can be applied to any ring, whether it is commutative or not. The concept of a commutative ring is not necessary for the definition of a reduced ideal to make sense.",
