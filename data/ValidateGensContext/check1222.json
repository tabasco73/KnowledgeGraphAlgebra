                "Explanation": "The concept of a 'Domain' as defined here pertains to functions, specifically the set of all possible input values for which a function is defined. This concept is distinct and unrelated to the concept of 'Units of a Ring' in algebra. The 'Units of a Ring' refers to elements within a ring that have a multiplicative inverse. The definition of 'Units of a Ring' does not require any understanding or application of the concept of a function's domain. It solely focuses on the properties of elements within a ring and their invertibility, independent of any function's domain or codomain. Therefore, understanding or defining a 'Domain' in the context of functions is not necessary for the definition or understanding of 'Units of a Ring'.",
