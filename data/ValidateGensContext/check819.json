                "Explanation": "The concept of a field involves a set and two operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain axioms such as associativity, commutativity, distributivity, the existence of additive and multiplicative identities, and inverses for every non-zero element. This definition does not inherently require the notion of ideals or their products.\\n\\nThe concept of the product of ideals pertains to ring theory, specifically to the study of structures within rings where ideals are subsets that are closed under addition and multiplication by any element of the ring. The product of ideals is a way to construct new ideals from existing ones, but this concept is not necessary for defining the basic properties of a field. In a field, every non-zero element is invertible, and thus the only ideals are the trivial ones (the zero ideal and the field itself).\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a field do not depend on the concept of the product of ideals. The product of ideals is relevant in more general ring-theoretic contexts, where non-invertible elements and non-trivial ideals exist, but not in the context of fields where such complexities are absent.",
