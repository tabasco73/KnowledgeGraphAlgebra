                "Explanation": "The concept of a submonoid is defined within the context of a monoid. A submonoid is a subset of a monoid that includes the identity element and is closed under the monoid's operation. This definition requires understanding what a monoid is, but it does not specifically require any knowledge of symmetric groups.\\n\\nA symmetric group, on the other hand, is a specific type of group consisting of all the bijective functions on a set of a certain size, forming a group under the operation of composition. While a symmetric group is an example of a group (and indeed a monoid, since every group is a monoid), the general concept of a submonoid does not depend on the concept of a symmetric group. The definition of a submonoid can be applied to any monoid, not just symmetric groups.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a submonoid does not inherently require the concept of a symmetric group. It is a broader concept applicable to any monoid, whether or not it is a symmetric group.",
