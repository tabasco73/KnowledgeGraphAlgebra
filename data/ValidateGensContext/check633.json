                "Explanation": "The concept of a splitting field specifically involves fields, as indicated by the definition where a splitting field $L$ of a polynomial $f$ with coefficients in a field $K$ is itself a field extension $L / K$. This definition inherently requires $L$ and $K$ to be fields, which are commutative division rings. However, the general concept of a division ring extends beyond fields to include non-commutative rings where every non-zero element is a unit. The definition of a splitting field does not require the broader concept of a division ring, as it specifically deals with fields (which are a special case of division rings where multiplication is commutative). Therefore, understanding or defining division rings in general (which includes non-commutative cases) is not necessary for the definition of a splitting field to make sense, as the latter strictly pertains to fields.",
