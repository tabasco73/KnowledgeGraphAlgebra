                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a monoid is necessary for the definition of a symmetric group, we need to analyze the definitions and requirements of each.\\n\\n1. **Symmetric Group Definition**: A symmetric group is defined as the group of all bijective self-maps of a set, specifically the set \\n{1, \\nldots, n}. This definition inherently includes the properties of a group, which are closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.\\n\\n2. **Monoid Definition**: A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and a unit element. While a monoid requires associativity and a unit element, it does not require every element to have an inverse.\\n\\n3. **Comparison**: Both a symmetric group and a monoid require associativity and a unit element. However, a symmetric group also requires every element to have an inverse, which is not a requirement for a monoid. Thus, a symmetric group has additional structure compared to a monoid.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: While the properties of a monoid are a subset of the properties of a symmetric group, the concept of a monoid itself is not necessary to define a symmetric group. The definition of a symmetric group can stand alone with its own requirements and does not depend on the concept of a monoid being defined first.",
