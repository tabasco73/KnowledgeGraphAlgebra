                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a subfield needs to be defined for the definition of a field extension to make sense, we can analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a field extension states that it involves a pair of fields $K \\subset L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This implies that $K$ must not only be a subset of $L$ but also a field in its own right, satisfying the properties of a field within the context of $L$.\\n\\n2. The definition of a subfield clarifies what it means for one field to be a subfield of another: a subring $T$ of a field $K$ is a subfield if $T$ itself is a field. This definition is crucial because it specifies the conditions under which a subset of a field can be considered a field, thereby meeting the criteria to be a subfield.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a subfield, the term 'subfield' used in the definition of a field extension would lack clarity. It would not be clear what properties $K$ needs to have relative to $L$ beyond being a mere subset. The definition of a subfield ensures that $K$ retains field properties within $L$, which is essential for the concept of a field extension.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a subfield is necessary to fully understand and define what a field extension is, as it provides the foundational criteria for $K$ being a part of $L$ in such a way that $K$ is also a field.",
