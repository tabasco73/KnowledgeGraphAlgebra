It states that two cycles are disjoint if the sets of elements in each cycle have no elements in common. This requires understanding what a set is, as it involves the collection of elements from each cycle and checking for common elements between these collections. Without the concept of a set, it would not be possible to form these collections or to understand the notion of having no elements in common, which is central to the definition of disjoint cycles.",
