An Integral Domain is defined as a commutative ring $R$ that is nonzero and does not admit nontrivial zero divisors.\\n\\nGiven these definitions, the concept of an Integral Domain is explicitly required to define a Principal Ideal Domain. The definition of a PID includes the condition that the ring $R$ must be an integral domain. Therefore, understanding what an integral domain is becomes essential to comprehending the full definition of a PID. Without the concept of an integral domain, the definition of a PID would be incomplete and unclear.",
