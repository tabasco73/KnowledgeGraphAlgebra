                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Set is necessary for the definition of a Sum of Ideals, we need to analyze the structure and requirements of each concept.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Sum of Ideals involves the expression \\(\\{a+b ; a \\in \\mathfrak{a}, b \\in \\mathfrak{b}\\}\\). This expression is a set-builder notation, which explicitly constructs a new set from elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that belong to the ideals \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{b}\\), respectively.\\n\\n2. The set-builder notation used in the definition of a Sum of Ideals inherently relies on the concept of a set, as it gathers elements into a collection, which is then treated as a single entity.\\n\\n3. The concept of a set, as defined, is a collection of distinct objects considered as an entity. This matches precisely with how the sum \\(\\mathfrak{a}+\\mathfrak{b}\\) is formed - as a collection (set) of elements formed by adding each element of \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) to each element of \\(\\mathfrak{b}\\).\\n\\n4. Without the concept of a set, the notion of collecting elements into a single entity, as required by the definition of a Sum of Ideals, would not be meaningful or possible. Thus, the concept of a set is fundamental and necessary for the definition of a Sum of Ideals to make sense.",
