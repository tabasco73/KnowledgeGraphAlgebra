                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Ring Homomorphism is necessary for the definition of a Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension, we need to analyze the requirements and definitions of each concept.\\n\\n1. **Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension**: This concept involves the group of field automorphisms of a finite field extension that fix the smaller field. A field automorphism is a bijective ring homomorphism that preserves the field structure, including addition and multiplication operations, and the identity element.\\n\\n2. **Ring Homomorphism**: This is a map between two rings that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication) and the identity element. A field automorphism, as required in the definition of the Galois group, is a special case of a ring homomorphism where the map is also bijective and the structures involved are fields rather than just rings.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that understanding and defining a ring homomorphism is fundamental to comprehending what a field automorphism is, since every field automorphism is a ring homomorphism with additional properties (bijectiveness and the structures being fields). Therefore, the concept of a ring homomorphism is indeed necessary for the definition of the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension.",
