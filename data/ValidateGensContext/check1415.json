                "Explanation": "Kronecker's construction involves extending a field by taking the quotient of the polynomial ring of the base field by an ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. This process does not inherently require the concept of the characteristic of the field. The characteristic of a field, defined as the smallest positive integer $p$ such that $p$ times the multiplicative identity equals zero, or infinity if no such $p$ exists, primarily affects the structure and properties of the field itself, such as the behavior of its elements under addition and multiplication.\\n\\nWhile the characteristic of the field can influence the choice of irreducible polynomials and the structure of the polynomial ring, it is not a prerequisite for understanding or applying Kronecker's construction. The construction fundamentally relies on the concepts of polynomial rings, ideals, and quotient rings. Therefore, the characteristic of the field, while potentially influential in deeper analysis or specific cases, is not necessary for the basic definition or understanding of Kronecker's construction.",
