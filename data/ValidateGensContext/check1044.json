                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Algebraic Field Extension is necessary for defining a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension states that it is an extension where every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This implies that each element in $L$ satisfies a polynomial equation with coefficients in $K$.\\n\\n2. The definition of an Algebraic Field Extension is that the extension field $L$ is algebraic over $K$ if every element in $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This definition essentially describes a field extension where all elements of the extended field are roots of non-zero polynomials with coefficients from the base field $K$.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension is a specific instance or subset of the broader concept of an Algebraic Field Extension. The term 'trivial' in this context implies that there is no element in $L$ that is not algebraic over $K$, which aligns with the definition of an Algebraic Field Extension.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding what it means for an extension to be algebraic (as defined in the Algebraic Field Extension) is crucial before one can comprehend what makes such an extension trivial. Without the concept of an Algebraic Field Extension, the definition of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension would lack context and clarity, as it directly relies on the notion of elements being algebraic over $K$.",
