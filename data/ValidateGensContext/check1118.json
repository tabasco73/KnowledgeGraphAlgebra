                "Explanation": "The concept of a Submonoid is defined within the context of a monoid, focusing on the properties of closure under the monoid operation and the inclusion of the identity element of the monoid. This definition is self-contained and relies solely on the properties of monoids and subsets thereof.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Cycle pertains to permutations within the symmetric group, specifically describing a type of permutation that rearranges a subset of elements in a specific cyclic order while leaving other elements fixed. This concept is specific to the study of permutations and group theory related to symmetric groups.\\n\\nThere is no inherent connection between the concept of a Cycle and the definition of a Submonoid. The definition and understanding of a Submonoid do not require any knowledge or application of the concept of a Cycle, as they belong to different areas of algebraic structure (monoids vs. permutations in symmetric groups). Therefore, the concept of a Cycle is not necessary for the definition of a Submonoid to make sense.",
