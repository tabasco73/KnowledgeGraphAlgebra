                "Explanation": "The concept of an Algebraic Element involves an element \\n\\being algebraic over a field, which means it satisfies a polynomial equation with coefficients from that field. This definition focuses on the existence of a polynomial equation that the element satisfies, and does not inherently require the operation in the field to be commutative. \\n\\nThe Commutative Law, on the other hand, pertains to the property of a binary operation being commutative in a set, meaning the order of operation does not affect the result. \\n\\nTo determine if the Commutative Law is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic Element, we need to consider if the operations in the field (addition and multiplication) being commutative affects the definition. Fields, by definition, have commutative addition and multiplication. However, the concept of an element being algebraic over a field does not inherently rely on these operations being commutative; it primarily requires that the element satisfies a certain polynomial equation. \\n\\nTherefore, while fields inherently have commutative operations, the definition of an algebraic element does not explicitly depend on the Commutative Law. It is the nature of fields themselves to be commutative, but this is not a prerequisite stated or required by the definition of an algebraic element itself.",
