                "Explanation": "The concept of a subset is defined purely in terms of element membership relative to another set. Specifically, a subset is a set where every element of it is also an element of another, larger set. This definition relies solely on the notion of set membership and does not require any operations to be defined on the elements of the set.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a law of composition refers to a binary operation defined on a set, where elements of the set are combined according to a specific rule to produce another element of the same set. This concept is related to the structure and operations within a set, rather than the membership of elements in one set relative to another.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a subset does not depend on whether a law of composition is defined on the set. The existence or definition of a law of composition is irrelevant to determining if one set is a subset of another. The concepts operate independently in the context of set theory.",
