                "Explanation": "According to the provided definitions, a map (or function) is described as a relationship between two sets, specifically associating every element in one set (the domain) to exactly one element in another set (the codomain). This definition inherently relies on the concept of a set, as it explicitly mentions and uses sets to define the domain and codomain of the map. Without understanding what a set is, one cannot fully comprehend what it means for elements to belong to a domain or a codomain, nor can the relationship (mapping) between these sets be understood. Therefore, the concept of a set is essential for the definition of a map/function to make sense.",
