                "Explanation": "The definition of a Transposition explicitly refers to a '2-cycle'. This implies that the concept of a cycle is inherently used to define what a transposition is. A transposition is described as a specific type of cycle, specifically one involving only two elements. Therefore, understanding what a cycle is, as defined in the given context, is crucial to comprehending the definition of a transposition. Without the concept of a cycle, the term '2-cycle' in the definition of a transposition would lack meaning, making it impossible to understand or apply the definition of a transposition correctly.",
