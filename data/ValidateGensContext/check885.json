                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a field needs to be defined for the definition of a splitting field of a polynomial to make sense, we can analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a splitting field explicitly mentions that it is a field extension $L / K$ where $K$ and $L$ are fields. This implies that both $K$ and $L$ must satisfy the properties of a field.\\n\\n2. The definition of a field as a commutative division ring establishes the mathematical structure and properties that $K$ and $L$ must have. Without this definition, the nature of $K$ and $L$ as fields would be unclear, and the concept of a field extension would not be well-defined.\\n\\n3. The concept of a field is fundamental in defining what it means for a polynomial to split into linear factors within $L$. The operations of addition and multiplication, which are defined under the structure of a field, are necessary for discussing how a polynomial splits.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a field is essential for the definition of a splitting field of a polynomial to be meaningful and complete. Without the definition of a field, the properties and operations within $L$ and $K$ cannot be properly understood or applied in the context of polynomial factorization.",
