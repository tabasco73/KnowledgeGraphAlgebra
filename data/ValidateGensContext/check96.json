                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition needs to be defined for a definition of a Ring Endomorphism to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies of the concepts involved.\\n\\n1. A Ring Endomorphism is defined as a homomorphism from a ring $R$ to itself. A homomorphism, in the context of rings, is a function that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication).\\n\\n2. A ring, by definition, is a set equipped with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain axioms. These operations are examples of laws of composition, as they map pairs of elements from the ring to another element in the ring.\\n\\n3. Therefore, the concept of a ring inherently includes the concept of laws of composition, since the operations within a ring are laws of composition.\\n\\n4. Since a Ring Endomorphism relies on the structure of a ring, and a ring's structure includes laws of composition (the operations), the concept of a Law of Composition must be defined and understood to properly define what a Ring Endomorphism is.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Ring Endomorphism to make sense, as it underpins the operations within a ring that a Ring Endomorphism must preserve.",
