                "Explanation": "The concept of a splitting field of a polynomial involves the idea of a field extension where a given polynomial can be factored completely into linear factors. This concept is purely algebraic, focusing on properties of fields and polynomials.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Cartesian product is a set-theoretic concept that involves creating a set of ordered pairs from elements of a set or sets. It is used in various areas of mathematics, including set theory, relations, and functions, but it does not directly relate to the algebraic structure of fields or the behavior of polynomials within those fields.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a splitting field do not require the concept of the Cartesian product. The Cartesian product does not contribute to the algebraic properties necessary to define or understand a splitting field.",
