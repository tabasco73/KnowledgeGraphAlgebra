            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Principal Ideal explicitly involves an element 'a' belonging to a set 'R', and the ideal itself is defined as the set of all products of 'a' with every element 'r' in 'R'. This set 'R' is referred to in the context of the definition, implying that 'R' is a structured set with specific operations defined on it, namely addition and multiplication. The operations and properties of these operations (associativity, distributivity, existence of a unit element) are essential for the concept of multiplication 'ra' to make sense and for the set of these products to form an ideal. \\n\\nThe definition of a Ring provides this necessary structure and operations. It defines 'R' as a set with addition and multiplication satisfying certain properties (commutative group under addition, monoid under multiplication, and distributive laws). Without the definition of a Ring, the operations performed in the definition of a Principal Ideal, such as multiplication of elements of 'R', would not have a well-defined meaning. Therefore, the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Principal Ideal to be meaningful and complete.",
