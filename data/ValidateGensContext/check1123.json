(iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The concept of a submonoid is defined strictly within the context of a monoid. A submonoid is a subset of a monoid that itself forms a monoid under the same operation as the original monoid. The definition of a submonoid requires the subset to contain the identity element of the monoid and to be closed under the monoid operation.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a ring is a more complex algebraic structure that includes two operations: addition and multiplication. While a ring is a monoid with respect to its multiplication operation, the concept of a ring also involves additional structures and properties, such as being a commutative group under addition and obeying the distributive laws.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding or defining a submonoid does not require the concept of a ring. The definition of a submonoid is complete with reference to the properties of monoids alone, without any need to reference or involve the additional structures that define a ring.",
