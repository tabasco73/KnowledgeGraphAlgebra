                "Explanation": "The concept of the kernel of a ring homomorphism is defined independently of the concept of a ring epimorphism. The kernel of a ring homomorphism, \\n$\\text{ker} \\\\(\\varphi\\\\)$, is defined as the set of elements in the domain ring $R$ that map to the zero element of the codomain ring $R'$ under the homomorphism $\\varphi$. This definition requires only the existence of a ring homomorphism and does not depend on the homomorphism being surjective, which is the defining property of a ring epimorphism.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of the kernel of a ring homomorphism does not require the concept of a ring epimorphism. The kernel can be defined and understood entirely within the context of a general ring homomorphism, regardless of whether it is surjective (an epimorphism) or not.",
