                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a commutative ring is necessary for defining a torsion submodule, we need to analyze the definitions provided and their interdependencies.\\n\\n1. The definition of a torsion submodule involves an A-module M. An A-module implies that there is a ring A acting on a module M. This definition does not specify that the ring A must be commutative; it only requires the existence of a ring.\\n\\n2. The definition of a commutative ring states that a ring R is commutative if its multiplication operation is commutative. This property of commutativity pertains specifically to the ring itself and does not inherently affect the definition of modules or submodules unless explicitly stated.\\n\\n3. The concept of torsion elements and torsion submodules in the context of modules does not inherently require that the underlying ring be commutative. The essential requirement is the existence of a ring (not necessarily commutative) and a module structure.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the definition of a torsion submodule can be applied to modules over any ring, whether commutative or not. The commutativity of the ring is an additional property that might affect other aspects of the module's structure or theory but is not a prerequisite for defining what a torsion submodule is.",
