                "Explanation": "To determine whether a group G is a p-group, we need to know the order of G. According to the definition of a p-group, the group G is a p-group if its order is a power of a prime number p. This directly implies that we must be able to determine the order of G to check if it is a power of p. Without the concept of the order of a group, we would not be able to define or identify a p-group because we wouldn't know how many elements the group contains or whether that number is a power of a prime. Therefore, the concept of the order of a group is essential for the definition of a p-group to make sense.",
