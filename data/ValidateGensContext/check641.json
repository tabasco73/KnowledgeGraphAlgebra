                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of a 'Normal Subgroup' to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a normal subgroup:\\n\\n1. A subgroup $H$ is defined as a subset of a group $G$. This implies that $H$ and $G$ are sets.\\n2. The definition states that $aH = Ha$ for all $a \\in G$. The notation $a \\in G$ explicitly uses the concept of an element of a set, indicating that $a$ is an element (or member) of the group $G$.\\n3. The equality $aH = Ha$ involves operations on elements of the group $G$ and the subgroup $H$, further emphasizing the role of elements within these sets.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is integral to the definition of a 'Normal Subgroup'. Without understanding what it means for an object to be an element of a set, the operations and conditions described in the definition of a normal subgroup cannot be properly understood or applied.",
