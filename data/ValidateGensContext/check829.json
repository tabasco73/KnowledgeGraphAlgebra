                "Explanation": "The concept of a Torsion submodule is defined within the context of modules over a ring. Specifically, a torsion submodule consists of all elements in a module that are annihilated by some nonzero element of the ring. This concept is inherently related to the structure of modules and the ring over which they are defined, but it does not require the structure of an algebra over a ring.\\n\\nOn the other hand, an Algebra over a Ring involves a more complex structure involving a ring homomorphism from a ring A to another structure B, which itself must also be a ring. This concept is used to study ring extensions and the interaction between different ring structures, but it is not necessary for defining or understanding torsion in modules.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an Algebra over a Ring is not required to define or understand a Torsion submodule. The definition and understanding of torsion submodules are complete with the concepts of rings and modules alone, without the need for the additional structure of an algebra over a ring.",
