A homomorphism between two $A$-algebras $B$ and $C$ is a ring homomorphism $B \\longrightarrow C$ that is compatible with the defining homomorphisms $A \\longrightarrow B$ and $A \\longrightarrow C$, ensuring the commutativity of the diagram involving these maps."

                "Explanation": "The concept of an integral element over a ring involves an element $b \\n B$ being integral over $A$ with respect to a ring homomorphism $\\varphi: A \\longrightarrow B$. This definition inherently requires a ring homomorphism from $A$ to $B$, but it does not require $B$ to be an algebra over $A$. The definition of an integral element focuses on the existence of a monic polynomial $f \\n A[X]$ such that $f(b)=0$, or similar conditions related to $A$-modules, none of which necessitate $B$ being an algebra over $A$. The definition of an algebra over a ring, on the other hand, involves a ring homomorphism from $A$ to $B$ and additional structure related to mappings between algebras, which is not required for defining integral elements. Therefore, while both concepts involve a ring homomorphism, the concept of an algebra over a ring is not necessary for the definition of an integral element over a ring.",
