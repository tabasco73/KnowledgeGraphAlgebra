                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field Extension is fundamental to defining the Degree of a Field Extension. According to the provided definitions:\\n\\n1. The Degree of a Field Extension is defined as the vector space dimension $[L: K] := \\operatorname{dim}_K L$, where $K \\subset L$ is a field extension.\\n2. The definition of the Degree of a Field Extension inherently relies on the existence of a field extension $K \\subset L$. Without this relationship, the concept of measuring the vector space dimension of $L$ over $K$ would not make sense.\\n3. The concept of a Field Extension itself is defined as a pair of fields $K \\subset L$ where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This relationship establishes $L$ as an extension field of $K$.\\n\\nThus, without the concept of a Field Extension, the definition and understanding of the Degree of a Field Extension cannot be established, as there would be no framework or context (i.e., the relationship $K \\subset L$) within which to define or measure the degree.",
