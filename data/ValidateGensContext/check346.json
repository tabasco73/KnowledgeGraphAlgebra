                "Explanation": "The concept of the units of a ring involves identifying elements within a ring that have multiplicative inverses. Specifically, an element 'a' in a ring 'R' is a unit if there exists an element 'b' in 'R' such that 'ab = 1' and 'ba = 1', where '1' is the multiplicative identity of the ring.\\n\\nThe commutative law, on the other hand, states that a binary operation (like multiplication in the context of rings) is commutative if the order of the operands does not affect the result; that is, 'ab = ba' for all 'a, b' in the set.\\n\\nFor the definition of units of a ring, the existence of a multiplicative inverse is crucial, but the commutativity of the multiplication operation is not. The definition of units does not inherently require that the multiplication be commutative. Units exist in both commutative rings (where 'ab = ba' for all 'a, b') and non-commutative rings (where 'ab' might not equal 'ba' for some 'a, b'). Therefore, the concept of the commutative law is not necessary for the definition of units of a ring to make sense.",
