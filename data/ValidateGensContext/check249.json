                "Explanation": "Kronecker's construction involves creating an extension field by taking the quotient of the polynomial ring of a base field by the ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. This process inherently requires the concept of an irreducible polynomial, as the ideal is specifically generated by such a polynomial. Without the concept of an irreducible polynomial, the ideal in Kronecker's construction would not be well-defined, and thus the entire construction would lack a necessary component. Therefore, the definition of an irreducible polynomial is essential for the definition of Kronecker's construction to be complete and meaningful.",
