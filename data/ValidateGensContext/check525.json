                "Explanation": "The concept of a Monoid involves a set with an associative binary operation and a unit element, which is a foundational concept in abstract algebra, particularly in the study of algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields. However, the definition of a splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield does not inherently require the concept of a monoid. The definition of a splitting field focuses on the field containing all roots of the polynomial and the polynomial being able to be factored into linear factors within that field. This definition primarily involves concepts from field theory and polynomial algebra, specifically the properties of fields and the behavior of polynomials within those fields.\\n\\nWhile monoids and fields are both algebraic structures, the specific properties and operations defining a monoid (associativity and the existence of a unit element in a general set) are not directly utilized in defining or understanding a splitting field of a polynomial. The field operations (addition and multiplication) do satisfy the monoid properties, but these properties are not unique or central to the concept of a splitting field. Therefore, the concept of a monoid is not necessary to define or understand a splitting field of the polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield.",
