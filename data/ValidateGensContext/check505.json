            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of an Irreducible Polynomial explicitly mentions that it is a polynomial in a ring $R[X]$. This implies that the concept of a ring is fundamental to the definition of an irreducible polynomial, as the polynomial itself is defined within the context of a ring. Without the concept of a ring, the set $R[X]$ and the operations on its elements would not be well-defined, making it impossible to discuss the factorization of polynomials within $R[X]$. Therefore, understanding and defining what a ring is becomes essential before one can properly define or discuss irreducible polynomials in that context.",
