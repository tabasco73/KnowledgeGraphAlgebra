More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

This definition requires the understanding of what a set is, but it does not require any understanding of the operations or additional structure (like a group operation) that might be defined on that set. A subset is purely a set-theoretic concept based on membership and inclusion.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a group involves a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties (associativity, identity element, and inverses). The definition of a group is more complex and includes additional structure beyond the mere concept of a set.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding or defining a subset does not depend on the concept of a group. The definition of a subset is complete with the understanding of sets alone, without any need to reference the additional structure required for a group. Thus, the concept of a group is not necessary for the definition of a subset to make sense.",
