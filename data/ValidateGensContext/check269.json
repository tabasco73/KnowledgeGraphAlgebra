                "Explanation": "The concept of an integral element over a ring involves the existence of a monic polynomial such that the element satisfies the polynomial equation, and considerations of subrings and modules generated by the element. The definition does not explicitly require the ring or the operations within the ring to be commutative. The integral element concept can be applied to both commutative and non-commutative rings. Therefore, the commutative law is not a necessary condition for the definition of an integral element over a ring to make sense. The integral element concept primarily focuses on the algebraic closure properties and generation of substructures within the ring, irrespective of whether the ring's multiplication is commutative.",
