                "Explanation": "The concept of a Finite Ring Homomorphism involves a ring homomorphism where the target ring $B$ is a finite module over the source ring $A$ via the homomorphism. This definition focuses on the algebraic structure and the finiteness condition of the module generated by the image of the homomorphism in the target ring.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Ring Epimorphism is defined as a surjective ring homomorphism. This concept emphasizes the surjectivity of the homomorphism, ensuring that every element of the target ring $R'$ is the image of some element in the source ring $R$.\\n\\nThe definition of a Finite Ring Homomorphism does not inherently require the homomorphism to be surjective; it only requires that the target ring be finite as a module over the source ring. Therefore, the concept of a Ring Epimorphism, which focuses on surjectivity, is not necessary for the definition of a Finite Ring Homomorphism to make sense. The finiteness condition can be satisfied without the homomorphism being surjective, as it pertains to the module structure rather than the mapping being onto.",
