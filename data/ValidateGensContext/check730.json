            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Polynomial Ring explicitly relies on the concept of a commutative ring R. The polynomial ring R[X] is defined as a set of sequences where each element of the sequence is an element of R, and these sequences represent polynomials with coefficients in R. The operations of addition and multiplication in the polynomial ring are also defined based on the operations in the ring R. Therefore, understanding what a ring is, specifically a commutative ring, is essential for defining the operations and structure of a polynomial ring. Without the concept of a ring, the definition of a polynomial ring would lack the foundational elements necessary for its algebraic structure and operations.",
