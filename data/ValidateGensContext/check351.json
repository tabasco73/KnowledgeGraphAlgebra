                "Explanation": "The concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension involves a field extension $K \\subset L$ where $L$ can be generated by finitely many elements from $K$. This concept inherently relies on the properties of fields, which include the commutative property of addition and multiplication. However, the definition of a Finitely Generated Field Extension itself does not explicitly require the definition or understanding of the Commutative Law as a separate concept. It is assumed as part of the field properties.\\n\\nThe Commutative Law, as defined, states that a law of composition (like addition or multiplication) on a set $M$ is commutative if $ab = ba$ for all elements $a, b \\in M$. While this property is essential for the operations within a field (and hence indirectly for the field extension), the definition of a Finitely Generated Field Extension does not directly depend on defining or stating the Commutative Law. The field's properties, which include commutativity, are prerequisites understood in the study of fields and field extensions.\\n\\nTherefore, while the commutative property is inherent in the operations within a field, the specific definition of the Commutative Law is not necessary to define or understand a Finitely Generated Field Extension. The concept of field extensions can be fully understood and applied without separately defining the Commutative Law, as long as one understands that fields are commutative rings.",
