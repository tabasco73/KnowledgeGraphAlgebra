                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a subring is necessary for the definition of a ring homomorphism of finite type, we need to analyze the components of the latter's definition. A ring homomorphism of finite type involves a mapping from one ring to another, specifically involving polynomial rings and the extension of the homomorphism to these polynomial rings. The definition explicitly mentions polynomial rings and the generation of the target ring B by elements from the image of A under the homomorphism, combined with additional elements. \\n\\nThe concept of a subring involves a subset of a ring that itself forms a ring under the inherited operations. While understanding subrings can provide deeper insights into the structure of rings and their homomorphisms, the definition of a ring homomorphism of finite type does not inherently require the concept of a subring. It focuses on the ability to express the target ring as generated by the image of the source ring and some additional elements, which is more about ring generation and extensions rather than the subring structure. \\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a subring is not necessary to understand or define a ring homomorphism of finite type. The essential concepts here are those of ring extensions and polynomial rings, not subrings.",
