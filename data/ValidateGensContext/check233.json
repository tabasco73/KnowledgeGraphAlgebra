A torsion submodule T of an A-module M consists of all torsion elements of M. This implies that T is a collection of elements from M that satisfy a specific property (being torsion).\\n\\n2. The definition of a submodule is a subset of an A-module M that is closed under the operations of M. This means that any subset of M that retains the structure of M (i.e., closed under addition and scalar multiplication) is a submodule.\\n\\n3. For T to be considered a torsion submodule, it must not only consist of torsion elements but also be closed under the operations of M. This closure under operations is what makes T a submodule of M.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a submodule is essential in defining a torsion submodule because it ensures that the torsion submodule T retains the algebraic structure of M, making it a legitimate submodule.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a submodule is necessary for the definition of a torsion submodule because it provides the framework within which the torsion elements form a structured subset (submodule) of M.",
