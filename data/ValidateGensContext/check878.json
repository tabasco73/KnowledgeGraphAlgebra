                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of trivial ideals needs to be defined for a field to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions and relationships between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of a Field**: A field is defined as a commutative division ring. This definition focuses on the algebraic structure where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse and multiplication is commutative.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Trivial Ideals**: Trivial ideals in a ring are the zero ideal and the unit ideal. In the context of a field, these are the only ideals that exist because every non-zero element is invertible, which prevents the formation of non-trivial ideals.\\n\\n3. **Relationship and Dependency**: The definition of a field inherently implies the existence of only trivial ideals due to its properties as a division ring. However, the concept of trivial ideals itself is not necessary to define what a field is. The definition of a field stands independently of the concept of ideals, trivial or otherwise. The concept of trivial ideals is more about the properties of ideals within the structure of a field rather than a prerequisite for understanding or defining a field.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: While the property that a field has only trivial ideals is an interesting and important characteristic, it is not necessary to define this concept for the definition of a field to make sense. The definition of a field is complete with its description as a commutative division ring.",
