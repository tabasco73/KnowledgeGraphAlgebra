            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of an irreducible element is inherently tied to the structure of a ring, specifically an integral domain, which is a special kind of ring. The definition of an irreducible element involves elements of a ring and the operations defined within that ring structure. It mentions that an element $p$ in a ring $R$ is irreducible if it cannot be factored into other elements of $R$ except as a product of a unit and another element. Without the concept of a ring, and by extension the operations and elements defined within a ring, the concept of an irreducible element would not have a meaningful context or framework. Therefore, the concept of a ring is necessary to properly define and understand what an irreducible element is.",
