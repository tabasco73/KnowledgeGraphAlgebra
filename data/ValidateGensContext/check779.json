                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the kernel of a ring homomorphism is necessary for the definition of a ring isomorphism to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Ring Isomorphism**: A ring homomorphism \\\\(\\nvarphi: R \\longrightarrow R'\\\\) is an isomorphism if it is bijective (both injective and surjective). This definition requires that there exists an inverse homomorphism \\\\(\\npsi: R' \\longrightarrow R\\\\) such that \\\\(\\npsi \\circ \\nvarphi=\\mathrm{id}_{R}\\\\) and \\\\(\\nvarphi \\circ \\npsi=\\mathrm{id}_{R'}\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Kernel of a Ring Homomorphism**: The kernel of a ring homomorphism \\\\(\\nvarphi: R \\longrightarrow R'\\\\) is the set of all elements in \\\\(\\nR\\\\) that map to zero in \\\\(\\nR'\\\\) under \\\\(\\nvarphi\\\\).\\n\\nThe concept of the kernel is useful for understanding properties of ring homomorphisms, such as injectivity. A ring homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel is trivial (i.e., contains only the zero element). However, the definition of a ring isomorphism does not explicitly require the concept of the kernel. It focuses on the bijectivity of the homomorphism and the existence of an inverse homomorphism. While the kernel concept helps in proving injectivity (a necessary condition for bijectivity), it is not explicitly required to define what a ring isomorphism is.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of the kernel of a ring homomorphism is not necessary for the definition of a ring isomorphism to make sense. The definition of isomorphism can stand independently by focusing solely on the bijectivity and the existence of an inverse homomorphism.",
