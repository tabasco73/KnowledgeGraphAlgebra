(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a solvable group involves the concept of groups, subgroups, normal subgroups, and abelian groups. It specifically requires a sequence of subgroups where each subgroup is normal in the previous one and the quotient of consecutive subgroups is abelian. This definition relies on group-theoretic concepts such as normality and the ability to form quotient groups, which are purely within the realm of group theory.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the definition of a ring involves a set equipped with two binary operations satisfying certain properties like associativity, commutativity (for addition), and distributivity. The concept of a ring is foundational in algebra but distinct from that of a group in its requirements and structure.\\n\\nThere is no direct or necessary connection between the concept of a ring and the concept of a solvable group as defined. The definition and understanding of a solvable group do not require any knowledge of rings, their structure, or their properties. Therefore, the concept of a ring is not needed to define or understand a solvable group.",
