                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Map/Function is necessary for the definition of a Left Coset, we need to analyze the components of each definition and their interdependencies.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Left Coset:** The definition of a left coset involves taking an element 'a' from a group 'G' and forming a set by multiplying 'a' with every element 'h' in a subgroup 'H' of 'G'. This results in a subset of 'G' of the form $aH = \\{ah; h \\in H\\}$.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Map/Function:** A map or function defines a relationship where each element of one set (domain) is associated with exactly one element of another set (codomain).\\n\\n3. **Analysis of Dependency:** The definition of a left coset does not inherently involve mapping elements from one set to another distinct set. Instead, it involves the operation of group multiplication within the same group 'G'. The process of forming a left coset is more about applying a group operation to elements of a subgroup rather than mapping elements between different sets.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the concept of a left coset primarily relies on the group operation and not on the association of elements between different sets, the concept of a Map/Function is not necessary for the definition of a Left Coset to make sense.",
