                "Explanation": "The definition of an ideal in a ring does not inherently require the ring to be Noetherian. An ideal is defined based on two properties: being an additive subgroup of the ring, and being closed under multiplication by any element of the ring. This definition applies to any ring, regardless of whether it is Noetherian or not.\\n\\nThe concept of a Noetherian ring, on the other hand, pertains to a specific property of the ring concerning the behavior of chains of ideals within it, specifically that every ascending chain of ideals terminates after finitely many steps. This is an additional property that a ring might have, but it is not a prerequisite for the existence or definition of ideals within a ring.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Noetherian ring is not necessary for the definition of an ideal to make sense. The definition of an ideal is general and applies to all rings, whether they are Noetherian or not.",
