                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a subset is necessary for the definition of a ring epimorphism, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Ring Epimorphism**: Defined as a surjective ring homomorphism, meaning every element in the target ring $R'$ must have a pre-image in the source ring $R$. This definition inherently involves the concept of surjectivity, which is a property of functions relating elements of one set (the domain) to another set (the codomain).\\n\\n2. **Subset**: Defined as a set where all of its elements are also contained within another set. This concept is fundamental in set theory and is used to describe the relationship between sets.\\n\\nIn the definition of a ring epimorphism, the concept of surjectivity implies that the image of the homomorphism (a set of elements in $R'$) equals the entire set $R'$. The notion of an image being equal to a set inherently uses the concept of subsets, as it involves comparing the elements of two sets (the image and the target set $R'$) to establish that one is a subset of the other (in this case, they are equal sets).\\n\\nTherefore, understanding and using the concept of subsets is essential in defining and understanding the concept of a ring epimorphism, as it relies on the idea that the image of the homomorphism is a subset that covers the entire target set.",
