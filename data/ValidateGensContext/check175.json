                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field Extension involves a pair of fields, $K$ and $L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This definition inherently implies that $L$ is an extension of $K$, but it does not specify the nature or structure of $L$ beyond it being a field that contains $K$. The definition of an Extension Field, specifically $\\mathbb{F}_q / \\mathbb{F}_p$, describes a particular type of field extension where the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is constructed as an extension of the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ with $q = p^n$ elements. This is a specific example of a field extension, but the general concept of a field extension does not depend on this particular structure. Therefore, the concept of a Field Extension can be understood and defined without necessarily referencing or requiring the specific concept of an Extension Field as defined here. The concept of a Field Extension is broader and can apply to any two fields where one is a subfield of the other, regardless of the specific characteristics of the extension.",
