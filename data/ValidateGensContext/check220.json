                "Explanation": "The definition of an algebraic subset involves the concept of a set of common zeros of polynomials from a polynomial ring over a field. This definition primarily relies on the structure of the polynomial ring and the field, and the operations within these structures (addition and multiplication of polynomials). The associative law, as defined, pertains to a general law of composition that satisfies $(ab)c = a(bc)$ for all elements in a set. While the associative property is indeed a fundamental property in the context of algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields, the definition of an algebraic subset itself does not directly invoke the associative law. It focuses on the zeros of polynomials and does not require the explicit use of the associative property in its formulation. Therefore, the associative law does not need to be defined or explicitly stated for the concept of an algebraic subset to make sense. The understanding of an algebraic subset can be complete without direct reference to the associative law.",
