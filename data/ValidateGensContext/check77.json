                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a symmetric group, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a symmetric group. The definition of a symmetric group states that it is the group of all bijective self-maps of the set \\(\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\). This definition inherently involves the concept of a set, specifically the set \\(\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\), which is a finite set of integers from 1 to n. A bijective self-map refers to a function that maps elements of this set to itself in a one-to-one and onto manner. Without the concept of a set, the notion of mapping elements from a collection to itself would not be meaningful, as there would be no defined collection (set) of elements to map. Therefore, the concept of a set is fundamental and necessary for the definition of a symmetric group, as it provides the structure within which the bijective functions operate.",
