                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Commutative Ring is necessary for the definition of a Trivial Algebraic field extension, we need to analyze the definitions and dependencies of these concepts.\\n\\n1. Definition of Trivial Algebraic Field Extension: This concept involves an extension $L / K$ where every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This definition inherently involves fields $L$ and $K$, which are special types of rings with additional properties (namely, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse).\\n\\n2. Definition of Commutative Ring: A ring is commutative if its multiplication operation is commutative. This is a broader concept than a field, as not all commutative rings are fields (they may lack multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements).\\n\\n3. Dependency Analysis: The definition of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension does not explicitly require the concept of a Commutative Ring. It directly deals with fields, which are already commutative rings by definition. Therefore, understanding fields suffices to grasp the concept of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension without separately considering the broader concept of Commutative Rings.\\n\\n4. Conclusion: Since fields are inherently commutative rings, and the definition of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension only involves fields, the concept of a Commutative Ring is not separately needed to understand a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension.",
