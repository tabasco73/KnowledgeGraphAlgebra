                "Explanation": "The definition of an Integral Ring Homomorphism explicitly relies on the concept of an element being integral over a ring. According to the provided definition, a ring homomorphism \\(\\varphi: A \\longrightarrow B\\) is integral if every element \\(b \\in B\\) is integral over \\(A\\) as defined by the concept of an Integral Element over a Ring. This means that for the definition of an Integral Ring Homomorphism to be meaningful and applicable, the concept of an Integral Element over a Ring must first be established and understood. Without this foundational concept, the definition of an Integral Ring Homomorphism would lack the necessary criteria to determine whether a given homomorphism is integral or not, as it directly depends on whether elements of \\(B\\) satisfy the conditions of being integral over \\(A\\).",
