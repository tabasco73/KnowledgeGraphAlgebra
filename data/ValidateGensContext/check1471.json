                "Explanation": "The definition of a Domain explicitly uses the concept of a Set. It states that the domain of a function is the 'set of all possible input values' for which the function is defined. This implies that the domain itself is a collection of inputs, which aligns with the definition of a Set as a 'collection of distinct objects considered as an entity.' Without the concept of a Set, the notion of a Domain would lack a clear structure to define what it means to be a collection of all possible input values. Therefore, understanding and defining a Domain inherently relies on the concept of a Set.",
