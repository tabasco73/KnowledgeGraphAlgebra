                "Explanation": "The concept of a Galois extension pertains to field theory, specifically dealing with extensions of fields. A field extension $K_r / K$ being Galois involves the conditions of being normal and separable. Normality means that the extension is closed under conjugation, and separability involves the minimal polynomial of any element in the extension being separable (having distinct roots).\\n\\nThe concept of a zero divisor is relevant in ring theory, where elements of a ring may multiply to give zero even though neither of the elements is zero. This concept is crucial in understanding the structure of rings, but not fields, as fields do not have zero divisors other than zero itself.\\n\\nSince a Galois extension deals with fields and not general rings, and fields inherently lack non-trivial zero divisors, the concept of zero divisors is not necessary for defining or understanding a Galois extension. The properties required to define a Galois extension (normality and separability) do not involve the concept of zero divisors.",
