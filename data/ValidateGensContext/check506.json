            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a torsion element involves an element 'x' of an A-module 'M' and an element 'a' in A-{0} such that a.x = 0. Here, 'A' refers to a ring, as the concept of an A-module implies that 'A' is a ring. A ring provides the algebraic structure necessary for defining operations like multiplication (used in the expression a.x = 0). Without the concept of a ring, the algebraic operations and the set A itself would not be properly defined, making it impossible to define what an A-module is or what it means for an element 'a' to multiply with 'x' to yield zero. Therefore, the concept of a ring is essential for the definition of a torsion element in the context of an A-module.",
