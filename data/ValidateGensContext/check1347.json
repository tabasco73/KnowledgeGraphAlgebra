                "Explanation": "The definition of a Law of Composition explicitly requires a map from $M \\times M$ to $M$. This means that the concept of a Cartesian product, which is defined as the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are elements of $M$, is essential for defining the domain of the map in the Law of Composition. Without the Cartesian product, we would not have a structured way to define all possible pairs of elements from $M$ that can be input into the composition function. Therefore, the concept of a Cartesian product is necessary for the definition of a Law of Composition to make sense, as it provides the framework for the pairs over which the composition operates.",
