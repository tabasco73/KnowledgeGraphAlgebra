The factor ring, or residue class ring, $R / \\mathfrak{a}$, is defined initially as an abelian group by viewing $\\mathfrak{a}$ as a (normal) subgroup of the additive group of $R$. The elements of $R / \\mathfrak{a}$ are all residue classes of type $x+\\mathfrak{a}$ for $x \\in R$, where addition is given by $(x+\\mathfrak{a})+(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x+y)+\\mathfrak{a}$ and multiplication by $(x+\\mathfrak{a}) \\cdot(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x \\cdot y)+\\mathfrak{a}$. The ring properties of $R$ carry over to $R / \\mathfrak{a}$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of the product of ideals involves taking elements from two ideals in a ring and forming sums of their products. This concept is purely based on the operations within the ring itself and the properties of ideals (like closure under addition and multiplication by ring elements). It does not require any notion of quotient structures or the factorization of the ring by an ideal.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a factor ring involves creating a new ring structure from an existing ring by considering the set of all cosets of an ideal in the ring. This concept is fundamentally about quotient structures and does not directly influence the definition or understanding of the product of two ideals.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding or defining the product of ideals does not depend on the concept of a factor ring. The product of ideals can be fully understood and utilized without any reference to factor rings, as it relies solely on the properties of ideals and the ring operations.",
