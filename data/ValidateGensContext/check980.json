            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of an Integral Element over a Ring, we need to analyze the components of each definition and their interdependencies.\\n\\n1. The definition of an Integral Element over a Ring involves elements of rings and ring homomorphisms. It specifically deals with elements satisfying certain polynomial equations, subrings being finitely generated as modules, and submodule properties within a ring.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Group involves a set with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element, and every element has an inverse. The group structure emphasizes invertibility and the associative property of the operation.\\n\\n3. The definition of an Integral Element over a Ring does not explicitly require any group properties such as invertibility of every element or the existence of an identity element in the context of group theory. It primarily focuses on ring and module properties, such as being solutions to polynomial equations and submodules being finitely generated.\\n\\n4. The concepts used in defining an Integral Element over a Ring (rings, ring homomorphisms, polynomials, modules) are distinct from those used in defining a Group. While both rings and groups are algebraic structures, the properties and operations relevant to each are different in this context.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Group is not necessary for understanding or defining an Integral Element over a Ring. The essential concepts for the latter are related to rings and modules, not the group-theoretic properties of invertibility and identity elements.",
