                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Division Ring is necessary for defining a Splitting Field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield, we need to analyze the definitions and requirements of each concept.\\n\\n1. **Splitting Field Definition**: A splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is a field that contains all zeros of the polynomial, and where the polynomial factorizes completely into linear factors. This definition inherently requires the structure to be a field, which is a particular kind of ring with additional properties, specifically that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.\\n\\n2. **Division Ring Definition**: A division ring is a ring in which every nonzero element is a unit, but it does not necessarily have to be commutative. Fields are a special case of division rings where the multiplication is commutative.\\n\\n3. **Necessity for Splitting Field Definition**: The definition of a splitting field specifically requires a field, not just any division ring, because the polynomial needs to factorize into linear factors, which is a property guaranteed in fields due to their algebraic structure. The commutativity of multiplication in fields (unlike in general division rings) is essential for the factorization properties used in defining splitting fields.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the definition of a splitting field explicitly requires a field, and since all fields are division rings but not all division rings are fields (due to the possible non-commutativity), the concept of a division ring itself is not necessary for the definition of a splitting field. The necessary and sufficient condition is the structure being a field, which is a more specific requirement than being a division ring.",
