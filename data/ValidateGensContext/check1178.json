                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field of Fractions is used to construct a field from an integral domain by considering ratios of its elements, similar to how rational numbers are formed from integers. This concept is essential when the original set is not already a field, as it allows for the introduction of division operations where every non-zero element has an inverse.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Finite Field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is already a field by definition, with all the properties of a field, including the existence of additive and multiplicative inverses for its elements. The Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field, $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$, consists of all non-zero elements of $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which inherently have multiplicative inverses due to the field properties of $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Field of Fractions is not necessary for the definition or understanding of the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field, as the field structure (and thus the existence of multiplicative inverses) is already established in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The Field of Fractions is relevant for integral domains that are not fields, to extend them to fields, which is not the case for finite fields.",
