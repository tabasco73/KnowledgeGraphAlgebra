                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition needs to be defined for a definition of a Ring Extension to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Ring Extension**: The definition states that a ring extension is a pair (S, R) where S is a subring of R. This implies that both S and R are rings.\\n\\n2. **Ring Definition**: A ring is typically defined as a set equipped with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties (associativity, distributivity, etc.). These operations are examples of laws of composition, as they map pairs of elements from the set back to the set.\\n\\n3. **Law of Composition**: This concept refers to a general operation on a set, mapping pairs of elements to another element in the same set. In the context of rings, the operations of addition and multiplication are specific instances of laws of composition.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a ring inherently includes the concept of laws of composition (for addition and multiplication). Therefore, understanding what a ring is (and thus what a ring extension is) necessarily involves understanding laws of composition. Without the concept of laws of composition, the operations within a ring, and hence the definition of a ring itself, would not make sense.",
