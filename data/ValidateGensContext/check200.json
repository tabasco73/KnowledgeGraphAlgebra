                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Field is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic Element, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definition of an Algebraic Element. The definition states that an element \\\\(\\alpha \\\\in L\\\\) is algebraic over \\\\(K\\\\) if it satisfies an algebraic equation with coefficients in \\\\(K\\\\), where \\\\(K \\\\subset L\\\\) is a field extension. This implies that \\\\(K\\\\) must be a field, as the concept of a field extension inherently requires \\\\(K\\\\) to be a field. Furthermore, the properties of fields (such as the existence of inverses for every non-zero element and commutativity) are crucial for defining the algebraic equation \\\\(\\alpha^{n}+c_{1} \\alpha^{n-1}+\\ldots+c_{n}=0\\\\). Without the structure of a field, the operations and properties assumed in the equation (like addition, multiplication, and the existence of inverses) would not necessarily hold. Therefore, the concept of a Field is essential for the definition of an Algebraic Element, as it provides the necessary mathematical structure and properties.",
