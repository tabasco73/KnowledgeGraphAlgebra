                "Explanation": "To determine the degree of a polynomial, one must first understand what a polynomial is. The definition of a polynomial provides the structure and components necessary to identify and evaluate its degree. Specifically, a polynomial is defined as a formal sum of terms, each consisting of a coefficient and a variable raised to a power. The degree of a polynomial is then defined as the highest power of the variable for which the coefficient is non-zero. Without the concept of a polynomial, the notion of 'degree' lacks context, as it specifically refers to the highest exponent in the polynomial's terms. Therefore, the concept of a polynomial is essential for the definition of the degree of a polynomial to be meaningful and applicable.",
