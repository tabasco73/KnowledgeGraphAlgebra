                "Explanation": "The concept of the length of an A-module, as defined, involves the supremum of lengths of chains of submodules within the module. This definition focuses on the structure of submodules and does not inherently require the concept of a basis or a free system of generators. The length of an A-module is concerned with the hierarchical arrangement of submodules and their maximal chains, rather than the linear independence or generating properties of elements within the module.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a free system of generators (basis) is defined as a set of linearly independent elements that generate the module. This concept is crucial in understanding the structure of the module in terms of its generators and their linear independence, but it is not directly related to the concept of the length of a module, which is more about the submodule structure rather than the properties of specific elements or generators.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of the length of an A-module do not depend on the concept of a free system of generators. The length can be defined and analyzed without reference to whether the module has a basis or not.",
