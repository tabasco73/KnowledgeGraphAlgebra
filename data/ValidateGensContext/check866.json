                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a division ring to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a division ring:\\n\\n1. A ring R is defined, which inherently involves the concept of a set since a ring is a set equipped with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that follow certain rules.\\n\\n2. The definition states that every nonzero element of R is a unit, implying the existence of a set of units R* which is defined as R - {0}. This subtraction operation indicates the removal of the zero element from the set R, forming a new set R*.\\n\\n3. The concept of the zero ring also involves the idea of a set, specifically a set containing only the zero element.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the definition of a division ring relies on the concept of sets to define what a ring is and to describe the properties of its elements. Without the concept of a set, the structure and operations within a division ring cannot be properly defined or understood.",
