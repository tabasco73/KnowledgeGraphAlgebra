                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of units of a ring is necessary for the definition of an irreducible polynomial, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Irreducible Polynomial**: A polynomial $f$ in a ring $R[X]$ is irreducible if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials in $R[X]$. This definition focuses on the inability to factorize the polynomial into simpler, non-constant polynomial components within the same ring of polynomials.\\n\\n2. **Units of a Ring**: The units of a ring $R$ are the elements in $R$ that are multiplicatively invertible. These elements form a set $R^*$.\\n\\nThe definition of an irreducible polynomial does not explicitly require the concept of units of a ring. It primarily concerns the factorization properties of polynomials within the polynomial ring $R[X]$. The irreducibility of a polynomial is about its factorization into polynomials of lower degree, and does not directly involve the invertibility (or unit status) of elements in $R$. While the units of a ring might influence the structure of the ring and hence the types of polynomials it can contain, the basic definition of irreducibility itself does not necessitate understanding or defining what the units of the ring are.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of units of a ring is not necessary for the definition of an irreducible polynomial to make sense. The irreducibility is determined by the ability or inability to factorize the polynomial within the ring of polynomials, independent of the concept of units.",
