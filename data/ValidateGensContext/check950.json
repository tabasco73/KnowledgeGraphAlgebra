More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a group is necessary for the definition of a normal subgroup to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a normal subgroup explicitly mentions a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$. It states that $H$ is a normal subgroup if $aH = Ha$ for all $a \\n G$. This implies that $H$ is a subset of some larger set $G$ which is assumed to have a group structure.\\n\\n2. The definition of a group provides the necessary structure and properties that $G$ must have for the operations and concepts in the definition of a normal subgroup to be meaningful. Specifically, the group structure ensures that operations like multiplication and taking inverses are well-defined, which are essential for forming and comparing the left and right cosets $aH$ and $Ha$.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a group, the operations and properties assumed in the definition of a normal subgroup (like coset formation and the equality of left and right cosets) would not have a well-defined context. The group properties ensure that every element has an inverse and that the operation is associative, which are critical for the manipulations involved in checking whether $aH = Ha$.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a group is essential for the definition of a normal subgroup to make sense, as it provides the foundational structure and operations needed to define and verify the properties of a normal subgroup.",
