                "Explanation": "The concept of a separable extension is important in the general theory of field extensions, particularly in the context of defining a Galois extension, which is both normal and separable. However, in the specific case of finite fields, every algebraic extension is automatically separable. This is because the minimal polynomial of any element in a finite field extension is separable due to the fact that finite fields are perfect; that is, every element in a finite field is a root of a separable polynomial. Therefore, when dealing with finite field extensions, such as $\\mathbb{F}_{q'} / \\mathbb{F}_q$, the extension is inherently separable, and the concept of separability does not need to be separately considered or defined for the definition of the Galois group of such an extension to make sense. The definition of the Galois group of a finite field extension as given does not explicitly require the concept of a separable extension because separability is a given in this context.",
