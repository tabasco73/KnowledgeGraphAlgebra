A monoid homomorphism $\\varphi: G \\longrightarrow G^{\\'prime}$ is a map $\\varphi$ from $G$ to $G^{\\'prime}$ such that (i) $\\varphi(e)=e^{\\'prime}$, (ii) $\\varphi(a b)=\\varphi(a) \\varphi(b)$ for all $a, b \\in G$. Furthermore, if $G, G^{\\'prime}$ are groups, $\\varphi$ is called a group homomorphism."

            "Let $G$ be a monoid. A subset $H \\subset G$ is called a submonoid if $H$ satisfies the following conditions: (i) $e \\in H$, (ii) $a, b \\in H \\Longrightarrow a b \\in H$. If $G$ is a group, $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if in addition, (iii) $a \\in H \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\in H$. In particular, a subgroup of a group $G$ is a submonoid that is closed under the process of taking inverses. In defining a subgroup $H \\subset G$, condition (i) can be weakened by simply requiring $H \\neq \\emptyset$, since this implies $e \\in H$ using (ii) and (iii). Of course, similar reasoning is not possible for monoids. Every group $G$ admits $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ as trivial subgroups. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the set $m \\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integral multiples of $m$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}$. We will see in 1.3/4 that all subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of this type. More generally, every element $a$ of a group $G$ gives rise to a so-called cyclic subgroup of $G$. It consists of all powers $a^{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where we put $a^{n}=\\left(a^{-1}\\right)^{-n}$ for $n<0; see also Section 1.3."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a subgroup involves certain properties that a subset of a group must satisfy to be considered a subgroup. These properties include the presence of the identity element, closure under the group operation, and closure under taking inverses. This definition is self-contained and does not reference or require the concept of a group homomorphism.\\n\\nA group homomorphism is a function between two groups that preserves the group operation. While group homomorphisms are important for studying relationships between groups and the structure of groups, they are not necessary for the definition of a subgroup. The concept of a subgroup can be fully understood and applied without any reference to group homomorphisms.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a group homomorphism is not needed for the definition of a subgroup to make sense. The definition of a subgroup is based solely on internal properties of a subset within a single group, independent of any external mappings or relationships to other groups.",
