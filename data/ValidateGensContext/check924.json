                "Explanation": "The definition of a Primitive Polynomial explicitly states that it is a polynomial with coefficients in a unique factorization domain (UFD), denoted as $R$. The concept of a primitive polynomial relies on the properties of a UFD to define the greatest common divisor (gcd) of its coefficients. In a UFD, elements can be factored uniquely into primes, which is crucial for determining the gcd of the polynomial's coefficients. If $R$ were not a UFD, the concept of gcd might not be well-defined or meaningful, and thus the definition of a primitive polynomial as given would not make sense. Therefore, the concept of a UFD is necessary for the definition of a primitive polynomial to be valid and meaningful.",
