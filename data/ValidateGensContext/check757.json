                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial is necessary for the definition of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. A Trivial Algebraic Field Extension $L / K$ is defined as an extension where every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This means that for each element $l$ in $L$, there exists a polynomial $f$ with coefficients in $K$ such that $f(l) = 0$.\\n\\n2. A Splitting Field of a Polynomial is a field extension $L / K$ where a specific polynomial $f$ with coefficients in $K$ splits into linear factors in $L$. This concept specifically relates to how a particular polynomial behaves in the extension $L$.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension focuses on the algebraic nature of all elements in the extension relative to the base field $K$, without requiring that any specific polynomial splits completely in $L$. The definition of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension does not depend on the behavior of any specific polynomial but rather on the general property that all elements of $L$ are roots of some polynomials with coefficients in $K$.\\n\\nIn contrast, the concept of a Splitting Field is tied to a specific polynomial and its behavior in the extension. While a Splitting Field is a type of algebraic extension (since elements that are roots of the polynomial are algebraic over $K$), not all algebraic extensions are splitting fields for a specific polynomial.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension does not inherently require the concept of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial. The two concepts operate independently in the general framework of field theory, with the Splitting Field being a more specific instance of an algebraic extension.",
