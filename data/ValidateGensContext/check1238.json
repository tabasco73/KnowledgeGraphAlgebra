            "Let $G$ be a monoid. A subset $H \\subset G$ is called a submonoid if $H$ satisfies the following conditions: (i) $e \\in H$, (ii) $a, b \\in H \\Longrightarrow a b \\in H$. If $G$ is a group, $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if in addition, (iii) $a \\in H \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\in H$. In particular, a subgroup of a group $G$ is a submonoid that is closed under the process of taking inverses. In defining a subgroup $H \\subset G$, condition (i) can be weakened by simply requiring $H \\neq \\emptyset$, since this implies $e \\in H$ using (ii) and (iii). Of course, similar reasoning is not possible for monoids. Every group $G$ admits $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ as trivial subgroups. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the set $m \\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integral multiples of $m$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}$. We will see in 1.3/4 that all subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of this type. More generally, every element $a$ of a group $G$ gives rise to a so-called cyclic subgroup of $G$. It consists of all powers $a^{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where we put $a^{n}=\\left(a^{-1}\\right)^{-n}$ for $n<0; see also Section 1.3."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a p-Sylow subgroup inherently relies on the concept of a subgroup. A p-Sylow subgroup is described as a specific type of subgroup of a finite group G, which is a p-group and satisfies certain divisibility conditions related to the group's order. The very notion of a p-Sylow subgroup presupposes the existence and understanding of what a subgroup is, as it is defined as a subgroup that meets additional criteria. Without the concept of a subgroup, the definition of a p-Sylow subgroup would lack foundational meaning, as it would not be clear what kind of mathematical structure is being referred to or how it fits within the larger structure of the group G. Therefore, the concept of a subgroup is essential and must be defined for the definition of a p-Sylow subgroup to be meaningful and coherent.",
