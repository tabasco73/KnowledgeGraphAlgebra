This new set, \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}+\\mathfrak{b}\\\\), consists of all possible sums of elements \\\\(a\\\\) from \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) from \\\\(\\mathfrak{b}\\\\). The definition of Sum of Ideals does not inherently involve mapping elements from one set to another set in a way that each element of the first set is associated with exactly one element of the second set, as defined in the concept of a Map/Function.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a Sum of Ideals can be fully grasped without the need to define or use the concept of a Map/Function. The operations involved are internal to the set of the ring \\\\(R\\\\) and involve addition within the ring, not mapping between different sets.",
