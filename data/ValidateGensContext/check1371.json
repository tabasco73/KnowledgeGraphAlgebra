                "Explanation": "The concept of a Factor Group involves the construction of a new group from a given group $G$ and a normal subgroup $N$. The definition of a Factor Group does not inherently require the concept of the order of a group. It primarily requires the understanding of what a group is, what a subgroup is, and specifically what a normal subgroup is. The operation in the factor group is defined based on the elements of $G$ and the subgroup $N$, and does not depend on the number of elements in $G$ or $N$. Therefore, the concept of the order of a group, which relates to the number of elements in a group, is not necessary for defining or understanding a factor group. The factor group can be defined and understood without any reference to the order of the original group $G$ or the subgroup $N$.",
