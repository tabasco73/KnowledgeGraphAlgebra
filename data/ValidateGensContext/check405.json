                "Explanation": "The definition of a Free A-module explicitly states that it is an A-module that has a basis, which is defined as a free system of generators. Therefore, the concept of a free system of generators (basis) is integral to understanding what constitutes a free A-module. Without the concept of a free system of generators, we would not be able to define what it means for an A-module to be free, as the definition relies on the existence of a basis to provide a unique representation for every element in the module. Thus, the concept of a free system of generators is necessary for the definition of a free A-module to make sense.",
