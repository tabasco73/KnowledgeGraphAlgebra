                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Ideal needs to be defined for the definition of a Sum of Ideals to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies between these concepts.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Sum of Ideals explicitly references 'ideals' $\\\\mathfrak{a}, \\\\mathfrak{b}$ in a ring $R$. This implies that the concept of an ideal is already assumed to be understood and defined.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Sum of Ideals involves operations and elements specifically pertaining to ideals, such as $a \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{a}$ and $b \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{b}$, and the operation $a+b$ where both $a$ and $b$ are elements of their respective ideals.\\n\\n3. Without understanding what an ideal is, specifically its properties and how it behaves under addition and multiplication by ring elements, one cannot fully comprehend or apply the definition of a Sum of Ideals. The properties of being an additive subgroup and closed under multiplication by any element of the ring are crucial to understanding why the set $\\\\{a+b ; a \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{a}, b \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{b}\\\\}$ forms another ideal.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the definition of an Ideal is fundamental and necessary for the definition of a Sum of Ideals to be meaningful and correctly applied.",
