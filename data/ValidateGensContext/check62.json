                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic Field Extension, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Algebraic Field Extension**: This definition involves an extension field $L$ over a base field $K$, where every element in $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This means each element in $L$ satisfies some polynomial equation with coefficients in $K$.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Law of Composition**: This concept refers to a binary operation on a set, which maps pairs of elements to another element within the same set. Common examples include addition and multiplication in algebraic structures.\\n\\n3. **Connection between the Concepts**: For $L$ to be a field, and thus for the concept of an algebraic field extension to make sense, $L$ must have defined operations of addition and multiplication that satisfy the field axioms (associativity, commutativity, identity elements, inverses, and distributivity of multiplication over addition). These operations are laws of composition as they map pairs of elements in $L$ to another element in $L$.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: The existence and properties of these operations (laws of composition) are essential for the structure of $L$ as a field. Without these operations, $L$ would not fulfill the requirements of a field, and thus the concept of it being an extension field of $K$, particularly an algebraic one, would not be properly defined or meaningful.",
