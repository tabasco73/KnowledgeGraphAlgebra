                "Explanation": "The definition of a Polynomial Ring explicitly states that it is formed from a commutative ring R. This implies that the ring R must adhere to the commutative law, meaning that for any two elements a and b in R, the operation ab equals ba. The polynomial ring R[X] inherits this property because its operations are defined based on the operations in R. Therefore, the concept of the commutative law is inherently required for the definition of a polynomial ring, as the underlying ring R must be commutative for R[X] to be properly defined and function as intended.",
