                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Algebraic Element is necessary for the definition of a Separable extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Separable extension states that an extension $L / K$ is separable if it does not contain any inseparable algebraic elements over $K$. This implies that the concept of algebraic elements is directly used in the definition of a separable extension, specifically focusing on whether these elements are inseparable or not.\\n\\n2. The definition of an Algebraic Element describes an element $\\\\(\\alpha \\\\in L\\\\)$ that satisfies a polynomial equation with coefficients in $K$. This definition is crucial because it specifies what kind of elements (algebraic elements) are being considered when discussing whether they are inseparable or not in the context of a separable extension.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of an Algebraic Element, the term 'inseparable algebraic elements' in the definition of a Separable extension would be undefined and unclear. Therefore, understanding what constitutes an algebraic element is essential to determining whether an extension is separable or not.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of an Algebraic Element is necessary for the definition of a Separable extension to make sense, as it provides the fundamental basis for identifying and classifying the elements within the extension that are relevant to its separability.",
