The factor ring, or residue class ring, $R / \\mathfrak{a}$, is defined initially as an abelian group by viewing $\\mathfrak{a}$ as a (normal) subgroup of the additive group of $R$. The elements of $R / \\mathfrak{a}$ are all residue classes of type $x+\\mathfrak{a}$ for $x \\in R$, where addition is given by $(x+\\mathfrak{a})+(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x+y)+\\mathfrak{a}$ and multiplication by $(x+\\mathfrak{a}) \\cdot(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x \\cdot y)+\\mathfrak{a}$. The ring properties of $R$ carry over to $R / \\mathfrak{a}$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a ring homomorphism involves a map between two rings that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication) and the multiplicative identity. This definition requires only the existence of two rings and does not inherently involve the concept of a factor ring. A factor ring, on the other hand, is defined as a construction that results from taking a ring and an ideal within that ring, and forming a new ring by considering the cosets of the ideal as elements. The concept of a factor ring is useful in many areas of algebra, but it is not a prerequisite for the definition or understanding of a ring homomorphism. The existence and properties of ring homomorphisms can be fully understood and applied without reference to factor rings. Therefore, the concept of a factor ring is not necessary for the definition of a ring homomorphism to make sense.",
