                "Explanation": "The concept of an Alternating Group is defined as the set of all even permutations of a symmetric group \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\), specifically those permutations where the sign (sgn) of the permutation is 1. This definition involves understanding permutations, the concept of evenness (determined by the sign of the permutation), and the structure of groups, particularly subgroups.\\n\\nThe concept of the Image of a Map pertains to functions and their outputs. It involves identifying all possible outputs (elements in set \\\\(B\\\\)) that result from applying a function \\\\(f\\\\) to elements in set \\\\(A\\\\). This concept is fundamental in understanding functions and their behavior but is not directly related to the definition or understanding of an Alternating Group.\\n\\nIn the definition of an Alternating Group, there is no direct reference or need to understand the image of a map. The Alternating Group's definition and understanding are rooted in the properties of permutations and group theory, specifically within the context of symmetric groups and not in the general behavior of functions between arbitrary sets.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of the Image of a Map is not necessary to define or understand an Alternating Group. The two concepts operate in different areas of mathematics (group theory vs. function theory) and do not overlap in this context.",
