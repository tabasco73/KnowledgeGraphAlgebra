                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a subset is necessary for the definition of a normal subgroup, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a normal subgroup. The definition states that a subgroup $H \\subset G$ is a normal subgroup if $aH = Ha$ for all $a \\in G$. The notation $H \\subset G$ explicitly uses the concept of a subset, indicating that $H$ is a subset of $G$. This implies that all elements of $H$ are also elements of $G$. Without understanding what a subset is, one cannot comprehend the meaning of $H \\subset G$, which is fundamental to the definition of a normal subgroup. Therefore, the concept of a subset is essential to understand and define a normal subgroup.",
