The definition of a Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field explicitly references a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This implies that the concept of a finite field is integral to understanding what the multiplicative group is.\\n\\n2. A finite field, by definition, is a special type of field. Therefore, understanding what a field is becomes essential to comprehending what a finite field entails.\\n\\n3. Since a field is defined as a commutative division ring, this property is crucial for the operations within the finite field, and consequently, for the operations within its multiplicative group.\\n\\n4. The multiplicative group of a finite field consists of all nonzero elements of the field under the operation of multiplication. Without the field structure, the properties and the existence of such a group cannot be established.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of a Field is necessary to define and understand the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field. Without the foundational concept of a Field, the structure and properties of the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field would not be logically coherent.",
