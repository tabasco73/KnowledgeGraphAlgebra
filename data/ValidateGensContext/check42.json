                "Explanation": "The definition of an algebraic subset involves the set of common zeros of polynomials from a subset of the polynomial ring over a field. This definition primarily relies on the concepts of fields, polynomial rings, and zeros of polynomials. The law of composition, which defines a binary operation on a set, is inherently present in the definition of a polynomial ring, as the ring operations (addition and multiplication) are examples of laws of composition. However, the specific concept of a law of composition as a general framework is not directly necessary to understand or define an algebraic subset. The algebraic subset's definition is more directly concerned with the properties and behaviors of polynomials and their zeros rather than the general concept of binary operations on a set. Therefore, while polynomial rings inherently use laws of composition (addition and multiplication), the general concept of a law of composition as defined does not need to be explicitly defined or understood to grasp the concept of an algebraic subset.",
