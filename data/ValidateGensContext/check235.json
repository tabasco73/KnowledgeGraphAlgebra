                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of an algebraic closure of a field is necessary for the definition of a Galois extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Galois Extension**: An extension $K_r / K$ is Galois if it is both normal and separable. This definition requires the extension to be normal (meaning that every irreducible polynomial in $K$ that has a root in $K_r$ splits completely in $K_r$) and separable (meaning that the minimal polynomial of every element in $K_r$ over $K$ has distinct roots).\\n\\n2. **Algebraic Closure of a Field**: An algebraic closure of a field $K$, denoted as $\\bar{K}$, is an algebraically closed field that is algebraic over $K$. This means $\\bar{K}$ contains all roots of all polynomials in $K$ and no polynomial in $\\bar{K}$ has repeated roots.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, the concept of an algebraic closure of a field is not explicitly required to define a Galois extension. The definition of a Galois extension focuses on the properties of the extension itself (normality and separability) and does not inherently require the existence of an algebraic closure. While the concept of an algebraic closure might be useful in broader discussions or proofs involving Galois extensions, it is not a prerequisite for the definition of a Galois extension itself.",
