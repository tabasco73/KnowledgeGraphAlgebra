            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a torsion element involves an element x of an A-module M and requires the existence of an element a in A (excluding 0) such that a.x = 0. This definition inherently relies on the structure of an A-module, which is a generalization of a vector space where the scalars come from a ring A instead of a field. The concept of a group, as defined, involves a set with an associative binary operation, a unit element, and inverses for every element. The definition of a torsion element does not require the elements of A or M to have inverses or a unit element, nor does it require the operation to be associative. Therefore, the concept of a group is not necessary to define a torsion element in an A-module. The essential structure needed is that of a ring (for A) and a module (for M), not a group.",
