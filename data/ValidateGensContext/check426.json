                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Division Ring is necessary for the definition of a Trivial Algebraic field extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. Trivial Algebraic field extension: This concept involves an extension $L / K$ where every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This definition inherently requires $L$ and $K$ to be fields, as the concept of being algebraic over another field pertains to fields.\\n\\n2. Division Ring: This is a ring where every nonzero element is a unit, but it does not necessarily have to be commutative. A field is a special case of a division ring where the operation is commutative.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, the concept of a Division Ring is broader than that of a field. The definition of a Trivial Algebraic field extension specifically requires the structures involved to be fields (which are commutative division rings), not just any division ring. Therefore, understanding or defining a Division Ring is not necessary for understanding a Trivial Algebraic field extension, as the latter specifically deals with fields and their algebraic extensions, not the broader concept of division rings which includes non-commutative elements.",
