            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of the Center of a group explicitly relies on the concept of a group. The Center is defined as the set of all elements in a group $G$ that commute with every other element in $G$. This definition inherently requires the existence of a group $G$ because it refers to elements within this group and their interactions (commutation) with each other. Without the concept of a group, which provides the structure and properties such as associativity, identity, and inverses, the definition of the Center would lack context and meaning, as there would be no set $G$ or group operations to refer to. Therefore, the concept of a group is essential for the definition of the Center to be meaningful and applicable.",
