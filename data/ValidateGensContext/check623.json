                "Explanation": "The definition of a Noetherian ring focuses on the properties of ideals within a single ring, specifically that every ascending chain of ideals in the ring stabilizes or that every ideal is finitely generated. This definition is self-contained and does not reference or require the concept of another ring or a subring relationship, which is central to the concept of a ring extension.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a ring extension involves two rings, where one ring is a subring of the other. This concept is used to study the properties and relationships between two different rings, which is a different context from the internal properties of a single ring as considered in the definition of a Noetherian ring.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Noetherian ring does not inherently require the concept of a ring extension. The definition and understanding of a Noetherian ring can be fully grasped without reference to or dependence on the concept of a ring extension.",
