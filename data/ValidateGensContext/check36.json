                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Right Coset, we need to analyze the components of each definition and their interdependencies.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Right Coset involves the subset $Ha = \\{ha; h \\in H\\}$, where $H$ is a subgroup of a group $G$ and $a \\in G$. This definition inherently uses the operation of multiplication (or some form of binary operation) denoted as $ha$, where $h$ and $a$ are elements of the group $G$.\\n\\n2. The concept of a group $G$ implies the existence of a binary operation on $G$ that satisfies certain properties (associativity, identity, and inverses). This binary operation is a specific type of Law of Composition, as it maps pairs of elements from $G$ to $G$.\\n\\n3. Therefore, the operation used in forming the right coset $Ha$ is a Law of Composition, specifically the group operation. Without this operation, the elements $ha$ cannot be defined, and consequently, the right coset itself cannot be formed.\\n\\n4. Thus, the definition of a Right Coset inherently relies on the existence of a Law of Composition (the group operation) on $G$. Without this law, the concept of a right coset would not make sense, as there would be no defined way to combine elements of $H$ and $G$ to form the subsets $Ha$.",
