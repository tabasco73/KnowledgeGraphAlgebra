                "Explanation": "The definition of the Klein Four-Group explicitly states that it is a subgroup of the symmetric group $\\\\frak{S}_{4}$. This implies that the concept of the symmetric group must be understood first in order to comprehend what $\\\\frak{S}_{4}$ represents, as it refers to the group of all permutations of four elements. Without understanding what a symmetric group is, one cannot fully grasp the structure or the elements of the Klein Four-Group, since its elements are described as specific permutations within $\\\\frak{S}_{4}$. Therefore, the concept of a symmetric group is necessary to define and understand the Klein Four-Group.",
