This definition requires the concepts of rings, ring homomorphisms, and surjectivity.\\n\\n2. **Division Ring**: Defined as a ring where every nonzero element is a unit, essentially a non-commutative generalization of a field.\\n\\nThe definition of a Ring Epimorphism does not inherently require that either the domain or codomain rings be Division Rings. It only requires the structures to be rings and the mapping to be a surjective homomorphism. The properties specific to Division Rings, such as every nonzero element being a unit, are not relevant to the definition or understanding of a Ring Epimorphism.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Division Ring is not necessary for the definition of a Ring Epimorphism to make sense. The essential concepts for a Ring Epimorphism are those related to general ring theory and the properties of homomorphisms.",
