                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Map/Function is necessary for the definition of a Factor Group, we need to analyze the components of the Factor Group definition:\\n\\n1. **Normal Subgroup and Group**: The definition of a Factor Group starts with a normal subgroup $N$ of a group $G$. This involves understanding groups and subgroups, but not necessarily maps or functions directly.\\n\\n2. **Set of Left Cosets**: The factor group $G/N$ is defined as the set of left cosets of $N$ in $G$. A coset $aN$ is formed by multiplying each element of $N$ by $a$ in $G$. This operation does not inherently require the concept of a map or function.\\n\\n3. **Group Operation on Cosets**: The operation on the cosets $(aN) \\times (bN) = (ab)N$ is defined in terms of group multiplication, which is an internal operation within the group $G$ and does not explicitly require the concept of a map or function.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the definition of a Factor Group primarily relies on the concepts of groups, subgroups, and cosets, and does not inherently require the concept of a map or function. The operations and constructions used in defining a Factor Group are internal to the group and do not involve mapping elements between different sets in the sense required by the definition of a map or function.",
