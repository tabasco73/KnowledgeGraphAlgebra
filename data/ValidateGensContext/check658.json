                "Explanation": "The definition of the Image of a Ring Homomorphism explicitly relies on the existence of a ring homomorphism, denoted as \\(\\varphi: R \\longrightarrow R'\\). The image is defined as \\(\\varphi(R)\\), which is the set of all outputs of \\(\\varphi\\) when applied to elements of the ring \\(R\\). Without the concept of a ring homomorphism, the operation \\(\\varphi\\) and its properties would not be defined, and thus the concept of its image, which depends on what \\(\\varphi\\) outputs when applied to elements of \\(R\\), would not make sense. Therefore, the concept of a ring homomorphism is necessary for the definition of the image of a ring homomorphism to be meaningful.",
