More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a solvable group inherently relies on the concept of a group. According to the definition provided, a solvable group is a type of group that has a specific structure involving a chain of subgroups. Each subgroup in the chain must be a normal subgroup of the previous one, and the quotient of consecutive subgroups must be abelian. This definition presupposes the existence of groups and subgroups, as well as concepts like normal subgroups and quotient groups, all of which are defined within the framework of group theory. Therefore, without the concept of a group, the definition of a solvable group would not make sense because it would lack the foundational elements necessary to understand what a group, subgroup, normal subgroup, and quotient group are.",
