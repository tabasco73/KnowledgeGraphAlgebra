The image of a ring homomorphism ($\\operatorname{im} \\varphi$) is defined as $\\varphi(R)$, which is explicitly stated to be a subring of $R'$. This means that $\\varphi(R)$ must satisfy the properties of a subring within $R'$.\\n\\n2. A subring is defined as a subset of a ring that is both a subgroup under addition and a submonoid under multiplication, and which inherits the ring operations from the larger ring.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a subring is integral to the definition of the image of a ring homomorphism. The image is not just any subset of $R'$; it must specifically be a subring, meaning it must meet the criteria laid out in the definition of a subring. Therefore, without the concept of a subring, the definition of the image of a ring homomorphism as given would not make sense, as it relies on the subset $\\varphi(R)$ being a subring of $R'$, which in turn requires understanding what a subring is.",
