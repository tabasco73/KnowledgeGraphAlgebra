                "Explanation": "The concept of a Polynomial Ring, as defined, involves a commutative ring R and does not inherently require R to be an integral domain or a field. The definition of a Polynomial Ring R[X] only requires the elements of R to be able to form sequences that represent polynomials, with operations of addition and multiplication defined accordingly. The Polynomial Ring can be constructed over any commutative ring, regardless of whether it has zero divisors or not.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Field of Fractions is specifically defined for integral domains, which are a special type of commutative ring without zero divisors. The Field of Fractions Q(R) represents a way to construct a field from an integral domain by considering ratios of its elements, similar to how rational numbers are constructed from integers.\\n\\nSince the definition of a Polynomial Ring does not require the underlying ring R to be an integral domain, and since it does not involve the construction of ratios or fractions of elements of R, the concept of a Field of Fractions is not necessary for the definition of a Polynomial Ring to make sense. The Polynomial Ring can exist independently of whether a Field of Fractions can be defined for R or not.",
