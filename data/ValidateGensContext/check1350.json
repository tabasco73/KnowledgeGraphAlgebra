                "Explanation": "The definition of a unit or neutral element inherently relies on the existence of a law of composition. According to the provided definition, a unit element $e$ in a set $M$ satisfies $ea = a = ae$ for all $a \\\\$in M$. This property can only be evaluated if there is a defined operation (law of composition) that dictates how elements in $M$ are combined. Without such a law, the expressions $ea$ and $ae$ have no meaning, as there is no specified way to 'multiply' or 'combine' $e$ and $a$. Therefore, the concept of a unit or neutral element is meaningful only in the context of a specific law of composition that defines how elements of the set are combined.",
