                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a splitting field of a family of polynomials is necessary for defining the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting fields, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields**: This concept specifically refers to the group of automorphisms of the splitting field of a single polynomial that fix the base field. The automorphisms in question permute the roots of that polynomial.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Splitting Field of Family of Polynomials**: This concept extends to a family of polynomials, where the field must decompose each polynomial in the family into linear factors and be generated by the zeros of these polynomials.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting fields inherently relies on the existence of a splitting field for that specific polynomial. However, it does not necessarily require the broader concept of a splitting field for a family of polynomials. The definition of the Galois group focuses on the properties and automorphisms of the splitting field of a single polynomial, not necessarily a family.\\n\\nTherefore, while the concept of a splitting field (in general) is essential for defining the Galois group, the specific extension to a family of polynomials is not required for the definition of the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting fields.",
