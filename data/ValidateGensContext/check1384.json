                "Explanation": "The definition of a Polynomial Ring explicitly states that it is formed from a commutative ring R. The polynomial ring R[X] is defined as a set of sequences where each element of the sequence is an element of R, and the operations of addition and multiplication within R[X] rely on the properties of R being a commutative ring. Therefore, the concept of a commutative ring is essential to defining the operations and structure of a polynomial ring. Without the concept of a commutative ring, the definition of a polynomial ring would lack the necessary foundation for its algebraic structure and operations.",
