                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field Extension involves two fields, where one field is a subfield of another. This concept inherently requires both $K$ and $L$ to be fields already. The definition of a Field of Fractions, on the other hand, pertains to constructing a field from an integral domain by considering equivalence classes of pairs, essentially creating a field from a non-field structure. The Field of Fractions is relevant when starting with an integral domain that is not a field and you want to construct its field of fractions (like constructing the rational numbers $\\textbf{Q}$ from the integers $\\textbf{Z}$). However, for the definition of a Field Extension, both $K$ and $L$ are already fields. Therefore, the concept of a Field of Fractions is not necessary for the definition of a Field Extension to make sense. The Field Extension simply requires the existence of two fields, one being a subfield of the other, and does not depend on the process of constructing a field from an integral domain.",
