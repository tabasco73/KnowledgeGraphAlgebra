                "Explanation": "The definition of the Center of a group $G$ explicitly states that it is the centralizer of $G$. This means that the concept of the Center ($Z_G$) is directly defined using the concept of the Centralizer. The Center is described as the set of all elements in $G$ that commute with every element of $G$, which is exactly the definition of the centralizer of the entire group $G$. Therefore, understanding and defining the Centralizer is essential for the definition of the Center to make sense, as the Center is a specific case of the Centralizer where the subset $S$ is the entire group $G$. Without the concept of the Centralizer, the definition of the Center as given would not be complete or understandable.",
