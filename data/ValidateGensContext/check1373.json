                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the order of a group is necessary for the definition of a cyclic group, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a cyclic group states that a group $G$ is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. This means there exists an element $g$ in $G$ such that every element of $G$ can be expressed as some power of $g$. The definition also mentions an equivalent condition involving a surjective homomorphism from $\\\\$\\mathbb{Z}\\\\$ to $G$, which maps integers to elements of $G$ in a way that covers all elements of $G$.\\n\\n2. The definition of the order of a group is the total number of elements in the group, whether finite or infinite.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a cyclic group focuses on the way elements in the group are generated (specifically, by powers of a single element) and does not inherently require knowing the total number of elements in the group. The definition of a cyclic group does not use or depend on the concept of the order of the group. It is concerned with the structure and generation of the group rather than its size.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of the order of a group is not necessary for the definition of a cyclic group to make sense. The definition of a cyclic group stands independently of the group's order.",
