            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a System of generators involves a family of elements from an A-module M. An A-module, by definition, is a structure where the elements can be scaled by elements from a ring A. This means that the concept of a ring is fundamental to the definition of an A-module, as the ring provides the scalars used in the module operations.\\n\\nSince a System of generators is defined within the context of an A-module, and an A-module inherently requires a ring (as it consists of elements that are scaled by elements of a ring), the concept of a ring must be defined and understood first. Without the concept of a ring, the definition of an A-module, and consequently the definition of a System of generators, would not make sense. Therefore, the concept of a ring is necessary for the definition of a System of generators to be meaningful.",
