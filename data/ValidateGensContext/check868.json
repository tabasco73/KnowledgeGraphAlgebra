                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Set is necessary for the definition of a Factor Ring, we need to analyze the components involved in defining a Factor Ring. The definition of a Factor Ring involves the concept of a ring $R$ and an ideal $\\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\)$ in $R$. The elements of the factor ring $R / \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\)$ are described as residue classes of the form $x+\\mathfrak{a}$, where $x$ is an element of $R$. These residue classes are essentially subsets of $R$, each formed by adding every element of the ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ to a particular element $x$ of $R$. \\n\\nThe operation of addition and multiplication in the factor ring is defined on these residue classes. Since each residue class is a set (a subset of $R$), and since the factor ring itself is a collection of these residue classes, the entire structure of the factor ring relies on the concept of sets. The residue classes must be understood as sets of elements from $R$, and the factor ring as a set of these sets. \\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Set, which is defined as a collection of distinct objects considered as an entity, is fundamental in forming the concept of residue classes and, by extension, the factor ring itself. Without the concept of sets, the definition and structure of residue classes and factor rings would not be logically coherent.",
