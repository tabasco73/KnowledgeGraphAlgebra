                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Unit or Neutral Element is necessary for the definition of a Symmetric Group, we need to consider the properties of a group. A group, by definition, is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies four fundamental properties: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element (unit or neutral element), and the existence of inverse elements for every element in the group.\\n\\nThe symmetric group, denoted as $\\mathfrak{S}_{n}$, is defined as the group of all bijective self-maps of the set $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$. This definition inherently implies that $\\mathfrak{S}_{n}$ is a group, and thus must satisfy the properties of a group, including the existence of a unit or neutral element. The neutral element in the context of $\\mathfrak{S}_{n}$ is the identity permutation, which maps every element to itself and thus satisfies the condition $ea = a = ae$ for all permutations $a$ in $\\mathfrak{S}_{n}$.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a unit or neutral element is essential for the definition of a symmetric group to make sense, as it ensures that one of the fundamental properties of a group is met.",
