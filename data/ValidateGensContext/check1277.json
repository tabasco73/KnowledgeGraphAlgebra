                "Explanation": "The concept of a right coset involves taking a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ and an element $a$ from $G$, and forming a new set $Ha = \\{ha; h \\in H\\}$, where each element of the set is the product of an element $h$ from $H$ and the element $a$. This operation is defined purely within the context of group theory, specifically using the group operation defined on $G$. \\n\\nThe Cartesian product, on the other hand, involves taking two sets (in this case, the same set $M$ twice) and forming a set of all ordered pairs $(m, n)$ where $m$ and $n$ are elements of $M$. This concept is a fundamental part of set theory and is used to define product spaces in various mathematical contexts, but it does not directly relate to the operation of forming a right coset in group theory. \\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a right coset do not require the concept of the Cartesian product. The operations and the contexts in which they are used are distinct and independent of each other.",
