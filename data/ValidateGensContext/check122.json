                "Explanation": "The definition of the sign or signature of a permutation involves calculating a product of ratios, where each ratio is defined as \\(\\frac{\\pi(i)-\\pi(j)}{i-j}\\) for \\(i<j\\). This calculation does not require a law of composition as defined, which involves a binary operation on a set that maps pairs of elements from the set back to the set. The operation in the sign of a permutation involves standard arithmetic operations (subtraction and division) on integers, and the product of these operations, which are inherently defined in the field of integers. The law of composition, on the other hand, typically refers to operations that define algebraic structures like groups, rings, or fields, where the operation must be closed within the set. In the case of the sign of a permutation, the operation does not need to be closed over a specific set other than the integers, and it does not define a new algebraic structure but rather uses existing arithmetic operations. Therefore, the concept of a law of composition is not necessary for the definition of the sign or signature of a permutation to make sense.",
