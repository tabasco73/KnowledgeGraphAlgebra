                "Explanation": "The concept of the inverse of an element in a monoid or group is defined independently of the concept of the order of a group. The definition of an inverse of an element requires only the existence of an identity element and the associative property, which are properties of a monoid. The inverse of an element $a$ in a monoid $M$ is defined as an element $b$ such that $ab = e = ba$, where $e$ is the identity element of $M$. This definition does not require any knowledge or definition of the number of elements in the monoid or group, which is what the order of a group describes.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the order of a group is a concept that quantifies the number of elements in a group, which is unrelated to the existence or properties of individual elements within the group, such as their inverses. Therefore, the definition of an inverse does not depend on the concept of the order of a group.",
