            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Primitive Polynomial involves a polynomial with coefficients in a unique factorization domain (UFD) and focuses on the properties of these coefficients, specifically their greatest common divisor (GCD). The concept of a UFD is important here because it ensures the existence of prime elements and a well-defined GCD for any set of elements within the domain.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Group pertains to a set with a specific binary operation that satisfies certain axioms (associativity, identity element, and inverses). This concept is foundational in abstract algebra but is unrelated to the definition of a primitive polynomial as given. The properties and operations defined in a group do not directly influence or intersect with the criteria used to define a primitive polynomial in a UFD.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Group is not necessary to understand or define a Primitive Polynomial. The definition of a Primitive Polynomial is self-contained with respect to the properties of a UFD and does not require the structure or properties of a group.",
