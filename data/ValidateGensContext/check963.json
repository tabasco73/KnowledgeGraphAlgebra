            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a group is necessary for the definition of a p-group to make sense, we need to analyze the definition of a p-group and its reliance on the concept of a group.\\n\\n1. The definition of a p-group states that it is a finite group G where the order of G is a power of p, where p is a prime number.\\n2. The term 'group' in the definition of a p-group refers directly to the concept of a group as defined separately.\\n3. The definition of a group provides the foundational properties of what constitutes a group, including the existence of an associative law of composition, a unit element, and inverses for each element.\\n4. Without understanding what a group is, the definition of a p-group would lack context and clarity because it wouldn't be clear what properties the set G has or how its elements interact.\\n5. Therefore, the concept of a group must be defined and understood first to fully comprehend what a p-group is, as the latter is a specific type of group characterized by the order of its elements.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the concept of a group is indeed necessary for the definition of a p-group to make sense, as it provides the essential framework and properties that define what a p-group is.",
