(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

The definition of a Ring Monomorphism starts by referencing a 'ring homomorphism' between two entities, R and R', which are implied to be rings. This implies that the concept of a ring is already assumed to be understood and defined.\\n\\n2. A ring homomorphism itself is a function between two rings that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication). Without understanding what a ring is, specifically the operations and properties that define a ring, it would be impossible to define or understand what it means for a function to preserve these operations.\\n\\n3. Therefore, the definition of a Ring Monomorphism inherently depends on the definition of a Ring. Without the concept of a Ring, the concept of a Ring Monomorphism would lack the necessary context for its operations and properties, making it nonsensical.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a Ring is essential for the definition of a Ring Monomorphism to be meaningful and complete.",
