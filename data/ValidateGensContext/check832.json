This definition does not require the ring to be commutative, nor does it require the absence of zero divisors, which are the key characteristics of an integral domain.\\n\\nAn integral domain, by definition, is a commutative ring without zero divisors and is nonzero. These properties are not necessary for the definition of a Noetherian ring. A Noetherian ring can be non-commutative and can have zero divisors. Therefore, the concept of an integral domain is not necessary for the definition of a Noetherian ring to make sense.",
