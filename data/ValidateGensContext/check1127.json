(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

The elements of $R / \\mathfrak{a}$ are all residue classes of type $x+\\mathfrak{a}$ for $x \\in R$, where addition is given by $(x+\\mathfrak{a})+(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x+y)+\\mathfrak{a}$ and multiplication by $(x+\\mathfrak{a}) \\cdot(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x \\cdot y)+\\mathfrak{a}$. The ring properties of $R$ carry over to $R / \\mathfrak{a}$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Factor Ring inherently relies on the concept of a Ring. According to the definition provided, a Factor Ring is formed from a ring $R$ and an ideal $\\\\frak{a}$ in $R$. The Factor Ring, denoted as $R / \\\\frak{a}$, is constructed using the elements of the ring $R$ and the operations defined on $R$. The operations of addition and multiplication in the Factor Ring are directly derived from those in the ring $R$. Furthermore, the definition of an ideal $\\\\frak{a}$, which is central to the concept of a Factor Ring, presupposes the existence of a ring since an ideal is a special subset of a ring that satisfies certain properties with respect to the ring's operations. Therefore, without the concept of a Ring, the definition of a Factor Ring would not be meaningful as it would lack the foundational structure and operations from which it is derived.",
