The definition of a subgroup generated by a set starts with a group $G$ and a subset $X \\subset G$. This notation $X \\subset G$ explicitly uses the concept of a subset, indicating that $X$ is a subset of $G$. Without understanding what a subset is, one cannot comprehend the meaning of $X \\subset G$, and thus cannot fully grasp the definition of a subgroup generated by $X$. Therefore, the concept of a subset is essential for the definition of a subgroup generated by a set to be meaningful and complete.",
