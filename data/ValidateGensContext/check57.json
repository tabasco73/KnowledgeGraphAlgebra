                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Law of Composition needs to be defined for a definition of a p-group to make sense, we need to analyze the definition of a p-group and its reliance on the concept of a group. A p-group is defined as a finite group G where the order of G is a power of a prime p. The definition of a group inherently includes the concept of a Law of Composition, as a group is a set equipped with a binary operation (a law of composition) that satisfies certain axioms (associativity, identity element, and inverses). Therefore, understanding what a group is, and consequently what a p-group is, inherently requires understanding the Law of Composition. Without a Law of Composition, the structure of a group cannot be defined, and thus the concept of a p-group would not make sense. The Law of Composition is essential for defining the operation within the group, which is fundamental to the group's structure and the definition of a p-group.",
