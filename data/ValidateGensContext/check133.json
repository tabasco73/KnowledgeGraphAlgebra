(iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a ring includes the requirement that the set R, with respect to multiplication, forms a monoid. A monoid is defined as a set that is closed under an associative binary operation and has an identity element. Therefore, the associative law is explicitly required for the operation of multiplication in the definition of a ring. This means that the concept of the Associative Law must be defined and understood for the definition of a ring to be complete and make sense. Without the associative property of multiplication, the structure would not meet the criteria of a monoid, and hence would not satisfy the definition of a ring.",
