            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of an Integral Ring Homomorphism to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of an Integral Ring Homomorphism involves a ring homomorphism \\n\\(\\varphi: A \\longrightarrow B\\), which implies that both A and B are rings. This is because a ring homomorphism is a function between two rings that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication).\\n\\n2. Furthermore, the definition states that every element \\(b \\in B\\) must be integral over A. The concept of an element being integral over a ring inherently requires the understanding of what a ring is, as it involves elements satisfying a polynomial equation with coefficients from another ring.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a ring, the operations of addition and multiplication, and the structure of a ring (as defined), it would be impossible to discuss ring homomorphisms or elements being integral over a ring. Thus, the concept of a ring is fundamental and necessary for the definition of an Integral Ring Homomorphism to be meaningful and applicable.",
