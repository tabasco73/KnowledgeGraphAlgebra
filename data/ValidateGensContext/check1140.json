                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Algebraic Element is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts.\\n\\n1. The definition of an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field states that it contains all algebraic extensions of the base field $\\mathbb{F}_p$. An algebraic extension of a field is a larger field containing elements that are algebraic over the base field.\\n\\n2. The concept of an Algebraic Element is defined as an element in a larger field that satisfies a polynomial equation with coefficients from a smaller field. This directly relates to what constitutes an algebraic extension.\\n\\n3. Since an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field includes all algebraic extensions of $\\mathbb{F}_p$, and these extensions are composed of elements that are algebraic over $\\mathbb{F}_p$, understanding what it means for an element to be algebraic is essential.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of an Algebraic Element, we would not have a clear criterion for determining which elements belong in an algebraic extension and, by extension, in the algebraic closure.\\n\\n5. Therefore, the concept of an Algebraic Element is necessary to define what it means for an extension to be algebraic, which is a fundamental part of the definition of an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field.",
