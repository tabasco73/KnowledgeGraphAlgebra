                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Extension Field is necessary for the definition of a Simple Field Extension to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Simple Field Extension involves a field extension $K \\subset L$ where $L$ can be generated by adjoining a single element $\\alpha$ from $L$ to $K$. This definition inherently requires the concept of a field extension, which is a more general concept than that of an extension field as defined here.\\n\\n2. The definition of an Extension Field specifically refers to a field extension of finite fields where the size of the larger field is a power of the size of the smaller field. This is a specific instance of a field extension, particularly relevant in the context of finite fields.\\n\\n3. The concept of a Simple Field Extension does not specifically require that the fields involved be finite or have the specific structure described in the Extension Field definition. It only requires the general concept of a field extension, which is broader and includes infinite fields and fields not necessarily structured as finite fields described in the Extension Field definition.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Simple Field Extension does not specifically require the concept of an Extension Field as defined here. It only requires the broader concept of a field extension, which can include but is not limited to the specific cases described by the Extension Field concept.",
