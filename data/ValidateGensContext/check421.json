                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Isomorphism is defined independently of the specific type of rings involved. It requires only the existence of a bijective ring homomorphism between two rings, which ensures that the structure of the rings (in terms of addition and multiplication) is preserved. The definition of a Ring Isomorphism does not specify that these rings must be division rings, or any particular type of ring; it only requires that they are rings in the general sense.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Division Ring is a specific type of ring where every nonzero element is invertible. This property is not required for the definition of a Ring Isomorphism. The concept of a Ring Isomorphism can be applied to any rings, whether they are division rings, commutative rings, rings with identity, or any other type.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Division Ring is not necessary for the definition of a Ring Isomorphism to make sense. The definition of a Ring Isomorphism is valid and meaningful as long as the objects involved are rings, regardless of their additional properties.",
