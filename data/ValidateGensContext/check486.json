The factor ring, or residue class ring, $R / \\mathfrak{a}$, is defined initially as an abelian group by viewing $\\mathfrak{a}$ as a (normal) subgroup of the additive group of $R$. The elements of $R / \\mathfrak{a}$ are all residue classes of type $x+\\mathfrak{a}$ for $x \\in R$, where addition is given by $(x+\\mathfrak{a})+(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x+y)+\\mathfrak{a}$ and multiplication by $(x+\\mathfrak{a}) \\cdot(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x \\cdot y)+\\mathfrak{a}$.

                "Explanation": "The concept of a Factor Ring involves taking a ring $R$ and an ideal $\\\\frak{a}$ in $R$, and constructing a new ring $R / \\\\frak{a}$ by considering the residue classes of elements in $R$ modulo the ideal $\\\\frak{a}$. This construction is self-contained and relies solely on the properties of rings and ideals. It does not require any elements outside of these concepts, such as elements from a multiplicative system $S$ or the operations involved in forming fractions as in the localization of a ring.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of Localization of a Ring involves a different construction where a ring $R$ and a multiplicative system $S$ are used to form a new ring $S^{-1}R$ by considering fractions of elements of $R$ with denominators in $S$. This process is independent of the concept of ideals or factor rings, and it focuses on altering the structure of $R$ to include inverses of elements in $S$.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a Factor Ring do not depend on the concept of Localization of a Ring. Each concept operates independently within the theory of rings, serving different purposes and based on different subsets of ring elements and operations.",
