                "Explanation": "The definition of a Minimal Polynomial inherently involves the concept of a Field Extension. According to the provided definition, the minimal polynomial of an element \\(\\alpha\\) is defined within the context of a field extension, specifically where \\(K \\subset L\\) and \\(\\alpha \\in L\\) is algebraic over \\(K\\). The minimal polynomial is a polynomial in the polynomial ring of the base field \\(K\\) that has \\(\\alpha\\) as a root. Without the concept of a field extension, the notion of an element \\(\\alpha\\) being algebraic over a base field \\(K\\) and belonging to an extended field \\(L\\) would not make sense. Therefore, the concept of a Field Extension is necessary for the definition of a Minimal Polynomial to be meaningful and applicable.",
