                "Explanation": "The concept of a field involves a set with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain axioms such as associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and the existence of additive and multiplicative identities and inverses. These operations are defined on pairs of elements from the set, but the definition of the operations themselves does not inherently require the formal concept of the Cartesian product. The Cartesian product is a specific mathematical construct used to form pairs of elements from sets, which can be useful in more complex structures or in formal proofs, but it is not a prerequisite for defining the basic properties and operations of a field. The operations in a field can be understood and defined without explicitly using the Cartesian product, as they fundamentally concern relationships and rules within the set, not the structure of ordered pairs.",
