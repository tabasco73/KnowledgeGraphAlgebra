More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Dihedral Group explicitly refers to it as a 'group' of symmetries, implying that it adheres to the properties and structure defined under the concept of a Group. The Dihedral Group is described as being generated by permutations, which are operations that must satisfy the group properties such as associativity, existence of an identity element, and existence of inverses for each element. Without the foundational concept of a Group, which establishes these properties, the definition of a Dihedral Group would lack the necessary framework to specify that these operations form a structure that adheres to the rules of group theory. Therefore, understanding and defining a Dihedral Group inherently relies on the prior definition and understanding of what constitutes a Group.",
