                "Explanation": "The concept of the Field of Fractions specifically applies to integral domains and involves creating a field by considering all possible ratios of elements from the domain, where the denominator is non-zero. This is a specific case of localization where the multiplicative system $S$ consists of all non-zero elements of the integral domain $R$. Thus, the Field of Fractions $Q(R)$ is essentially the localization of $R$ at its non-zero elements, denoted as $R_{R \\setminus \\{0\\}}$. \\n\\nHowever, the general concept of localization extends beyond just creating fields from integral domains. It applies to any ring $R$ and any multiplicative subset $S$ of $R$, allowing the creation of a ring of fractions that may not necessarily be a field. \\n\\nTherefore, while the concept of localization includes the process used to define the Field of Fractions, understanding or defining the Field of Fractions does not inherently require prior knowledge of the broader concept of localization. The Field of Fractions can be understood and defined purely within the context of integral domains without referencing the more general concept of localization.",
