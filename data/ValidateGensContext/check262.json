                "Explanation": "The definition of a prime element in a unique factorization domain (UFD) focuses on the property of an element $p$ generating a prime ideal and its ability to divide at least one element in any product it divides. This definition is self-contained and does not inherently require the concept of a greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD concept is about finding an element that is the highest common divisor among a set of elements, which is a different aspect of divisibility. The prime element definition is concerned with the divisibility of individual products and does not involve comparing or combining divisibilities among multiple elements, which is the essence of the GCD. Therefore, the concept of a GCD is not necessary for the definition or understanding of a prime element in a UFD.",
