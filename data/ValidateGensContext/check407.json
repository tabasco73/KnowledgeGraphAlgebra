                "Explanation": "The concept of the Galois group of a field extension is a general definition that applies to any field extension, where the group consists of all automorphisms of the larger field that fix every element of the smaller field. This definition is crucial as it sets the foundational understanding of what a Galois group is in the context of field theory.\\n\\nThe concept of the Galois group of a finite field extension is a specific instance of the general concept, applied to finite fields. It specifies that the group is cyclic and its order is the degree of the extension, which is additional information specific to finite fields. However, the core idea of automorphisms fixing the smaller field remains the same.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding the general concept of the Galois group of a field extension is necessary to grasp the specific case of finite field extensions. Without the general concept, the specific definition lacks the foundational context needed to fully understand its structure and properties.",
