            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Polynomial specifies that it is a formal sum where the coefficients are elements from a field or a ring. This implies that the concept of a ring (or field, which is a special type of ring) is fundamental to defining what these coefficients are and how they behave. Without understanding what a ring is, one cannot fully grasp the structure and properties of the coefficients in a polynomial. Therefore, the concept of a ring is necessary to provide a complete and meaningful definition of a polynomial, as it establishes the algebraic framework within which polynomials operate.",
