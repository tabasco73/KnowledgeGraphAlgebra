                "Explanation": "The concept of an extension field focuses on the properties and structure of fields derived from a base field, specifically involving the number of elements and the characteristic of the field. The definition of an extension field involves the construction of a larger field from a smaller field, typically using powers of a prime number and the concept of a splitting field for a specific polynomial.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of trivial ideals pertains to the structure of ideals within a ring, specifically identifying the minimal and maximal ideals possible in any ring, and noting that in the special case of a field, these are the only ideals. This concept is related to the ring theory aspect of fields but does not directly influence the definition or understanding of what constitutes an extension field.\\n\\nTherefore, while trivial ideals are a fundamental aspect of understanding the structure of fields as rings, they are not necessary for defining or understanding the concept of an extension field. The definition and understanding of extension fields can be fully grasped without reference to the concept of trivial ideals, as the latter does not impact the former's fundamental definition or properties.",
