A Ring Endomorphism is defined as a homomorphism from a ring $R$ to itself. This definition requires the concept of a ring and the concept of a homomorphism, but it does not explicitly require the concept of a polynomial.\\n\\n2. A Polynomial is defined as a formal sum of terms with coefficients in a field or ring, expressed in powers of a variable $X$. This definition is specific to the structure and representation of polynomials and does not inherently relate to the structure or function of a ring beyond using elements from the ring as coefficients.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a polynomial is not necessary to define a ring endomorphism. The definition of a ring endomorphism is complete with the understanding of rings and homomorphisms alone, without any need to reference polynomials. Therefore, the concept of a polynomial is not needed for the definition of a ring endomorphism to make sense.",
