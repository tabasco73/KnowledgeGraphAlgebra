                "Explanation": "The definition of a System of Generators of an Ideal explicitly references the concept of an Ideal. It starts by stating 'Let \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) be an ideal of a ring \\(R\\).' This implies that the concept of an Ideal must already be understood and defined in order to make sense of what a System of Generators of an Ideal is. Without the definition of an Ideal, one cannot comprehend what \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) represents in the context of a System of Generators. Therefore, the concept of an Ideal is necessary to define and understand a System of Generators of an Ideal.",
