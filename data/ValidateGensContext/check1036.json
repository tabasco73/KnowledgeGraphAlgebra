                "Explanation": "The concept of an Algebraic Element pertains to field theory, specifically to the properties of elements within a field extension. An element is algebraic over a field if there exists a polynomial equation with coefficients in that field which the element satisfies. On the other hand, an Algebraic Subset involves the solution set of a system of polynomial equations over a field, focusing on the geometric or set-theoretic properties in an algebraic closure of that field. The definition of an Algebraic Subset does not inherently require the concept of an Algebraic Element. It primarily involves understanding the zeros of polynomials in a polynomial ring, without needing to reference individual elements' relationships to the field as algebraic or not. Thus, the definition and understanding of an Algebraic Subset can be fully grasped without the concept of an Algebraic Element.",
