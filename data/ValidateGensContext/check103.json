                "Explanation": "The definition of a polynomial does not inherently require the concept of units of a ring. A polynomial is defined as a formal sum of terms, each consisting of a coefficient from a ring or field and a power of a variable. The definition focuses on the coefficients and their arrangement in terms of powers of a variable. It does not depend on whether these coefficients are units (invertible elements) in their respective ring or field.\\n\\nThe concept of units of a ring pertains to the elements within a ring that have multiplicative inverses. While this concept is important in various areas of algebra, particularly in the study of ring properties and invertible functions, it is not necessary for the basic definition or understanding of what constitutes a polynomial. Polynomials can be formed and manipulated regardless of whether their coefficients are units.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of units of a ring is not a prerequisite for defining or understanding polynomials. Polynomials require only a set of coefficients and a variable, without any need for these coefficients to be invertible.",
