                "Explanation": "To define a Field of Fractions, we start with an integral domain $R$. The field of fractions $Q(R)$ is constructed from pairs $(a, b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are elements of $R$ and $b$ is not zero. These pairs are considered as elements of a larger set, specifically the set of all such pairs. The definition of a Field of Fractions inherently relies on the concept of elements of a set, as it involves the collection of pairs $(a, b)$ which are themselves elements of the set $R$. Furthermore, the equivalence classes that form $Q(R)$ are subsets of this set of pairs, and thus also rely on understanding what it means for these pairs to be elements of a set. Therefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is crucial in defining what it means for pairs $(a, b)$ to belong to $R$ and subsequently to the set of equivalence classes that define $Q(R)$. Without the concept of an element of a set, the structure and membership of $Q(R)$ cannot be properly defined or understood.",
