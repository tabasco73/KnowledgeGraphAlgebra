                "Explanation": "The concept of a K-homomorphism involves a field homomorphism between two field extensions that restricts to the identity map on the base field K. This definition is self-contained and does not inherently require any specific method of constructing the field extensions, such as Kronecker's construction. Kronecker's construction is a method for creating field extensions by adjoining roots of polynomials, but it is not the only method for constructing such extensions. The definition of a K-homomorphism is applicable regardless of how the field extensions L and L' are constructed, as long as they are extensions of the same base field K. Therefore, the concept of Kronecker's construction is not necessary for the definition of a K-homomorphism to make sense.",
