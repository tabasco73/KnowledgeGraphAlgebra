                "Explanation": "The definition of the product of ideals involves the multiplication of elements from two ideals in a ring, resulting in a set of sums of these products. This definition is self-contained and does not reference or require the concept of a maximal ideal. A maximal ideal is defined as a proper ideal that is not contained in any larger proper ideal except the ring itself. The concept of a maximal ideal relates to the structure of ideals within a ring in terms of containment and hierarchy, but it does not influence the basic operation of multiplying elements from two ideals to form their product. Therefore, understanding or defining a maximal ideal is not necessary for the definition or understanding of the product of ideals. The two concepts operate independently in the context of ring theory, where one can discuss and utilize the product of ideals without any reference to whether any of the ideals involved are maximal.",
