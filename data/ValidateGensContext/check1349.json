                "Explanation": "The definition of the Commutative Law explicitly relies on the concept of a law of composition. The Commutative Law states that a law of composition on a set $M$ is commutative if $ab = ba$ for all elements $a, b \\\\$in M$. This definition presupposes the existence of a law of composition, as it refers to the operation $ab$ which is defined under the law of composition. Without the concept of a law of composition, the operation $ab$ would not be defined, and thus the statement $ab = ba$ would be meaningless. Therefore, the concept of a law of composition is necessary for the definition of the Commutative Law to make sense.",
