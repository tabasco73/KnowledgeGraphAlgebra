                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of a 'Factor Group' to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a 'Factor Group'.\\n\\n1. The definition of a 'Factor Group' involves the formation of a group from the set of left cosets of a normal subgroup $N$ in a group $G$. This set is denoted as $G / N$.\\n\\n2. Each left coset in $G / N$ is of the form $aN$ where $a$ is an element of $G$. This implies that each coset $aN$ is a subset of $G$, and $a$ is an element of the group $G$.\\n\\n3. The group operation in the factor group is defined on these cosets, specifically $(aN) \\bullet (bN) = (ab)N$. Here, $a$ and $b$ are elements of $G$, and their product $ab$ must also be an element of $G$.\\n\\n4. The concept of an 'Element of a Set' is fundamental in defining what $a$ and $b$ are in relation to $G$. Without understanding that $a$ and $b$ are elements of the set $G$, the operation $(ab)N$ and the formation of cosets $aN$ and $bN$ would not be meaningful.\\n\\n5. Therefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is crucial in defining the operations and the structure of the factor group, as it underpins the understanding of what constitutes the cosets and how they interact within the group structure.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of a 'Factor Group' to make sense, as it provides the basic understanding of membership and interaction within the set that forms the group $G$ and its cosets.",
