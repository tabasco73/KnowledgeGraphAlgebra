                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Left Coset, we need to analyze the components of each definition:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Left Coset involves the subset $aH = \\{ah; h \\in H\\}$, where $a \\in G$ and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. This subset is formed by multiplying each element $h$ of $H$ by the element $a$.\\n\\n2. The operation used in forming $aH$ is the multiplication of elements of $G$, which is a group. By definition, a group $G$ has a binary operation (a law of composition) defined on it that is associative, has an identity element, and each element has an inverse.\\n\\n3. The Law of Composition is defined as a map from $M \\times M$ to $M$, which assigns a product to each pair of elements. In the context of groups, this law of composition is the group operation itself.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Law of Composition (group operation in this case) is essential for the definition of a Left Coset, as the formation of the coset $aH$ directly relies on the ability to 'multiply' or combine elements of the group $G$ according to this law. Without a defined law of composition, the operation $ah$ for $h \\in H$ would not make sense, and thus the concept of a left coset could not be properly defined.",
