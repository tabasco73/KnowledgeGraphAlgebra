                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Algebraic Field Extension is necessary for defining a Separable extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Algebraic Field Extension**: This concept is defined as an extension where every element in the extension field $L$ is algebraic over the base field $K$. An element $\\beta$ is algebraic over $K$ if there exists a non-zero polynomial $f(x) \\\\in K[x]$ such that $f(\\beta) = 0$.\\n\\n2. **Separable Extension**: This is defined as an extension $L / K$ where every element in $L$ is separable over $K$. An element is separable over $K$ if the minimal polynomial over $K$ that has the element as a root has distinct roots in its splitting field.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of separability inherently involves elements being algebraic, as separability is defined in terms of properties of the minimal polynomial of algebraic elements. Therefore, for an extension to be considered separable, it must first be algebraic. This implies that the concept of an Algebraic Field Extension is indeed necessary to properly define what a Separable extension is, as the latter concept relies on the elements of the extension being algebraic over the base field $K$.",
