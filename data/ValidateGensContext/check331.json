The rank of an A-module M is defined as the supremum of all numbers n such that there exists a linearly independent system of elements x_1, ..., x_n in M. This definition focuses on the existence of a linearly independent set of elements in M, but it does not explicitly require that these elements form a basis or a free system of generators.\\n\\n2. A free system of generators (basis) is defined as a family of elements of an A-module M that is linearly independent and spans M. This definition includes the condition of linear independence as well as the additional requirement that the set spans M.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, we see that the concept of rank relies solely on the existence of linearly independent sets, not necessarily on these sets forming a basis or spanning M. Therefore, the concept of a free system of generators (basis) is not strictly necessary for the definition of rank, as rank only requires the existence of linearly independent sets, irrespective of whether they span M or not.",
