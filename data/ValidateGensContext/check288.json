                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an algebraically closed field is necessary for the definition of a splitting field of a family of polynomials to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions and relationships between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Splitting Field**: A splitting field of a family of polynomials over a field K is an extension field L in which every polynomial in the family decomposes into linear factors, and L is generated by the roots of these polynomials. This definition requires that there exists a field L where the polynomials split completely, but it does not require that L itself be algebraically closed.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Algebraically Closed Field**: An algebraically closed field is one in which every nonconstant polynomial has a root, and thus splits completely into linear factors within the same field.\\n\\n3. **Relationship and Necessity**: The concept of a splitting field is about finding an extension field where a given set of polynomials can split, not about the field itself being algebraically closed. The definition of a splitting field does not inherently require the field to be algebraically closed; it only requires that there exists some extension in which the polynomials can be completely factored. The concept of an algebraically closed field is broader and ensures that any polynomial will split within the field itself, which is not a requirement for the definition of a splitting field.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of an algebraically closed field is not necessary for the definition of a splitting field to make sense. The splitting field needs to be an extension where specific polynomials split, but it does not need to satisfy the broader condition of being algebraically closed for all polynomials.",
