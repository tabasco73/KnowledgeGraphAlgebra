                "Explanation": "The definition of a Euclidean domain involves an integral domain $R$ and a function $\\\\$\\delta: R-\\{0\\} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\\\$ that allows for Euclidean division, where for any $f, g \\in R$ with $g \\neq 0$, there exist $q, r \\in R$ such that $f = qg + r$ with $\\\\delta(r) < \\\\delta(g)$ or $r = 0$. This definition focuses on the existence of a specific function and the ability to perform division with remainder within the ring itself.\\n\\nThe concept of the localization of a ring, on the other hand, involves creating a new ring from a given ring $R$ and a multiplicative system $S$ by forming fractions $\\\\frac{a}{s}$ where $a \\in R$ and $s \\in S$. This process is about extending $R$ to include inverses of elements in $S$, which is a different operation from what is described in the definition of a Euclidean domain.\\n\\nThus, the concept of localization is not necessary for the definition of a Euclidean domain. The Euclidean domain concept is self-contained with its requirements and does not rely on the ability to form fractions or extend the ring as in localization.",
