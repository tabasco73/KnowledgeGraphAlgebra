                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field Extension is defined as a pair of fields $K \\subset L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This definition simply requires that $L$ be a field that contains $K$ as a subfield, and does not inherently require any specific method of constructing $L$ from $K$. \\n\\nKronecker's Construction, on the other hand, is a specific method for constructing an extension field by using the quotient of a polynomial ring by an ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. This method is just one of several ways to construct field extensions, but it is not necessary for the definition of what a field extension is. The definition of a field extension is broader and can encompass other methods of extension, such as simple algebraic extensions or transcendental extensions, which do not rely on Kronecker's Construction.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of Kronecker's Construction is not needed for the definition of a Field Extension to make sense. The definition of a Field Extension is independent of the method used to construct the extension, including Kronecker's Construction.",
