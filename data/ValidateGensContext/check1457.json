                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a 'Cycle' needs to be defined for the definition of 'Disjoint Cycles' to make sense, we must analyze the dependency of the latter on the former. The definition of 'Disjoint Cycles' refers to two cycles, $(x_{1}, \\\\.\\.\\.\\., x_{r})$ and $(y_{1}, \\\\.\\.\\.\\., y_{s})$, and states that these cycles are disjoint if their corresponding sets of elements have no elements in common. This definition inherently relies on the understanding of what a 'cycle' is, as it uses the term directly and assumes knowledge of the structure and properties of cycles. Without the concept of a 'Cycle', as defined by the permutation properties and the specific arrangement of elements in a sequence where the last element maps back to the first, the term 'disjoint' in the context of cycles would lack clarity and specificity. Therefore, the concept of a 'Cycle' must be clearly defined and understood before one can fully comprehend what 'Disjoint Cycles' are.",
