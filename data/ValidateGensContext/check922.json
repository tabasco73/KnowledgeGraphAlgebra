(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The concept of the Image of a Map involves understanding the relationship between elements of two sets, A and B, through a function f. This concept is purely about the mapping of elements from one set to another and the resultant set formed by these mappings. It does not inherently require any operations such as addition or multiplication to be defined on these sets.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Ring involves a set equipped with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain algebraic properties. This concept is specific to algebraic structures and is unrelated to the basic definition of a function or its image.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of the Image of a Map do not depend on the properties or existence of a Ring. The Image of a Map is a fundamental concept in set theory and function theory, which can be understood independently of algebraic structures like Rings.",
