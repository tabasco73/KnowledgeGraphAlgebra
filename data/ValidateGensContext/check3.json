            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a ring focuses on the algebraic structure defined by two binary operations: addition and multiplication. These operations must satisfy certain properties such as associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the distributive laws. The concept of an ideal, including the intersection of ideals, pertains to certain subsets of a ring that are closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of the ring. However, the basic definition and understanding of a ring do not require the concept of ideals or their intersections. Ideals and their intersections are additional structures used in more advanced studies of ring theory, particularly in the context of ring homomorphisms and ideal-related theorems. Therefore, the concept of the intersection of ideals is not necessary for the definition of a ring to make sense. It is an advanced concept that builds upon the basic definition of a ring.",
