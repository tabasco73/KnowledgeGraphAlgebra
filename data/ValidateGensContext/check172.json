                "Explanation": "The concept of an Alternating Group involves the set of all even permutations of a symmetric group, which inherently relies on the properties of permutations including their composition. Permutations, as functions, follow the associative law when composed. This means that for any three permutations \\\\(\\\\sigma, \\\\tau, \\\\rho\\\\), the composition \\\\((\\\\sigma \\\\circ \\\\tau) \\\\circ \\\\rho = \\\\sigma \\\\circ (\\\\tau \\\\circ \\\\rho)\\\\) holds true. This associative property is crucial for the group structure, as it ensures that the composition of permutations within the group (including the alternating group) is well-defined and obeys group axioms.\\n\\nThe definition of the Alternating Group does not explicitly mention the Associative Law, but the underlying group structure (in this case, permutations forming a group under composition) inherently requires the Associative Law to be valid. Therefore, the concept of the Associative Law is necessary for the definition of an Alternating Group to make sense, as it ensures that the group operations are consistent and follow the standard group axioms.",
