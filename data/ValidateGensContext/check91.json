                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a subfield is necessary for defining a normal field extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. Normal field extension: This concept involves an extension field, which is a larger field containing a smaller field (base field). The definition mentions that the extension field must be a splitting field for polynomials from the base field. It also involves the concept of homomorphisms from the extension field to its algebraic closure, and conditions related to the behavior of polynomials with coefficients in the base field.\\n\\n2. Subfield: This concept defines a subfield as a subring of a field that is itself a field.\\n\\nIn the definition of a normal field extension, the base field and the extension field are inherently subfields of a larger field (possibly an algebraic closure). Understanding and defining what constitutes a subfield is crucial because it establishes the foundational relationship between the base field and the extension field. Without the concept of a subfield, the relationship between the base field and the extension field, and the conditions involving homomorphisms and polynomial behavior, would not be properly framed or understood.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a subfield is necessary to properly define and understand a normal field extension, as it underpins the structural relationship and properties that characterize the extension.",
