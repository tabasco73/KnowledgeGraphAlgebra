                "Explanation": "The concept of a Galois extension involves an extension being both normal and separable. The definitions of normal and separable extensions do not inherently require the concept of the degree of the extension. A normal extension is one where every irreducible polynomial in $K[x]$ that has a root in $K_r$ splits completely in $K_r[x]$. A separable extension is one where the minimal polynomial of every element in $K_r$ over $K$ has distinct roots. Neither of these definitions directly involves the degree of the field extension, which is defined as the dimension of $L$ as a vector space over $K$. Therefore, the concept of the degree of a field extension is not necessary for defining a Galois extension. The degree of the extension is a separate concept that quantifies the 'size' of the extension but does not influence the criteria for an extension being Galois.",
