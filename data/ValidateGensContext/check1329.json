                "Explanation": "According to the provided definitions, a polynomial is defined as a formal sum $f=\\sum_{j=0}^{n} a_{j} X^{j}$, where $a_{j}$ are explicitly referred to as the coefficients. This definition inherently includes the concept of coefficients as an integral part of what constitutes a polynomial. The coefficients $a_{j}$ are necessary to specify the terms of the polynomial, and each term of the polynomial is defined by its coefficient and the corresponding power of $X$. Without the concept of coefficients, the definition of a polynomial would lack the necessary elements to describe its structure and terms. Therefore, the concept of a coefficient of a polynomial is essential for the definition of a polynomial to be complete and meaningful.",
