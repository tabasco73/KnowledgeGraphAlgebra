                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Map/Function is necessary for the definition of a K-homomorphism, we need to analyze the structure of the definition of K-homomorphism. The definition states that a K-homomorphism is a field homomorphism \\(\\sigma: L \\longrightarrow L'\\) between two field extensions \\(L / K\\) and \\(L' / K\\), which restricts to the identity map on \\(K\\). A field homomorphism is a specific type of function that preserves the field operations (addition and multiplication). The definition of K-homomorphism inherently involves the concept of a function or map, as it describes a relationship (homomorphism) that maps elements from one field to another while preserving certain properties. Furthermore, it specifically mentions that it restricts to the identity map on \\(K\\), which is itself a function that maps each element to itself. Therefore, the concept of a map or function is integral to understanding and defining what a K-homomorphism is, as it fundamentally describes a mapping process between elements of fields.",
