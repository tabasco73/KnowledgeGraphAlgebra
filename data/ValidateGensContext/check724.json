                "Explanation": "To understand the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting field, we need to comprehend the concept of automorphisms, which are specific types of functions. An automorphism in this context is a bijective function from the splitting field to itself that preserves the structure of the field. This means it respects operations like addition and multiplication and fixes elements of the base field.\\n\\nSince automorphisms are functions, and the definition of a function (or map) is essential to defining what an automorphism is, the concept of a map or function is indeed necessary. Without understanding what a function is, one cannot fully grasp what an automorphism does or how it operates within the context of a Galois group. Therefore, the concept of a map or function is crucial for defining the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting fields.",
