            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a 'Subgroup generated by a set' inherently relies on the concept of a 'Group'. According to the provided definition, a subgroup is formed within the context of a pre-existing group $G$ and is the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ that contain a subset $X$. This definition presupposes the existence of a group $G$, as it references elements and subgroups of $G$. Without the concept of a group, the terms 'subgroup', 'elements of $G$', and the operations described (such as the inverse and the law of composition) would not have a meaningful context. Therefore, understanding what a group is, including its properties and structure, is essential before one can meaningfully discuss what a subgroup generated by a set is.",
