                "Explanation": "The definition of a field states that it is a commutative division ring. This implies that the operations within the field, specifically multiplication, must satisfy the commutative law, meaning that for any two elements a and b in the field, the equation ab = ba must hold. Therefore, the concept of the Commutative Law is inherently required to understand and define what a field is, as the commutativity of the multiplication operation is a fundamental aspect of the structure of a field.",
