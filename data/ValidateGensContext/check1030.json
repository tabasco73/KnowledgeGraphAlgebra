                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Set is necessary for the definition of the Sign or Signature of a Permutation, we need to analyze the components involved in the definition of the Sign or Signature of a Permutation.\\n\\n1. The definition of the Sign or Signature of a Permutation involves a permutation \\\\(\\pi\\\\) which is an element of \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\). The notation \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\) refers to the symmetric group on \\\\(n\\\\) elements, which is the set of all permutations of the set \\\\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\\\).\\n\\n2. A permutation itself is a bijective function from a set to itself. In this case, the set is \\\\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\\\).\\n\\n3. The concept of a set is fundamental in defining what a permutation is, as a permutation is a rearrangement of the elements of a set.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of a set, the notion of a permutation would not make sense because there would be no collection of distinct objects to rearrange. Consequently, the concept of the Sign or Signature of a Permutation, which depends on the existence of permutations, would also not make sense.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Set is necessary for the definition of the Sign or Signature of a Permutation to make sense.",
