                "Explanation": "The definition of the kernel of a ring homomorphism explicitly relies on the existence of a ring homomorphism, as indicated by the phrase 'Let \\(\\varphi: R \\longrightarrow R'\\) be a ring homomorphism.' The kernel is defined based on the elements of the domain ring \\(R\\) that are mapped to the zero element of the codomain ring \\(R'\\) by the ring homomorphism \\(\\varphi\\). Without the concept of a ring homomorphism, the operation \\(\\varphi(a) = 0\\) and the set \\(\\{a \\in R ; \\varphi(a)=0\\}\\) would have no meaning because \\(\\varphi\\) would not be defined as a function with specific properties (additive and multiplicative preservation). Therefore, the concept of a ring homomorphism is essential for defining what the kernel of such a homomorphism is.",
