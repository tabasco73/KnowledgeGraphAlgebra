                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a set is necessary for defining a normal field extension, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a normal field extension:\\n\\n1. **Extension Field**: This concept inherently involves sets since fields are sets with additional algebraic structure (operations of addition and multiplication that satisfy certain axioms).\\n\\n2. **Splitting Field**: A splitting field of a polynomial is a type of field extension specifically constructed as the smallest field containing all roots of the polynomial. The roots of a polynomial, and hence the elements of the splitting field, form a set.\\n\\n3. **Family of Polynomials**: A family of polynomials can be thought of as a set of polynomials.\\n\\n4. **Base Field and Algebraic Closure**: Both of these are sets with additional structure (field structure).\\n\\n5. **Homomorphisms and Automorphisms**: These are functions between fields (which are sets), and understanding their properties involves understanding subsets and mappings between sets.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of a set is fundamental to defining fields, polynomials, and operations on them. Without the concept of a set, the structure and operations of fields, as well as the notion of homomorphisms and automorphisms, would not have a clear foundation. Therefore, the concept of a set is necessary to properly define and understand a normal field extension.",
