Definition of a Monoid: A monoid is defined as a set with an associative law of composition and a unit element. This structure provides a foundational algebraic framework.\\n\\n2. Definition of a Group: A group is defined as a monoid with the additional property that every element has an inverse. This definition explicitly states that a group is a type of monoid but with an extra condition regarding inverses.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a monoid is integral to the definition of a group. The group definition builds directly on the monoid structure by adding the requirement of inverses for every element. Without understanding what a monoid is, the definition of a group would be incomplete and less coherent because the associative property and the existence of a unit element are fundamental to the operation of groups, which are inherited from the monoid structure.",
