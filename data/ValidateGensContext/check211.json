                "Explanation": "The concept of a reduced ideal in a ring involves the notion of the radical of an ideal, which is defined using powers of elements within the ring. The definition of a reduced ideal does not explicitly require the associative law; it primarily involves the properties of elements and their powers within the ideal and the ring.\\n\\nHowever, the underlying structure of a ring, where the reduced ideal is defined, inherently includes the associative law as part of its definition. A ring is a set equipped with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties including the associative law for multiplication. This associative property is crucial for the general operation of the ring, particularly in handling expressions involving multiple products, such as calculating powers of elements which is necessary for defining the radical of an ideal.\\n\\nTherefore, while the definition of a reduced ideal does not directly invoke the associative law, the concept of a ring, within which the reduced ideal exists, inherently relies on the associative law. Thus, the associative law must be defined and understood as part of the broader mathematical framework in which reduced ideals are studied.",
