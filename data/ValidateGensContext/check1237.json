(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Noetherian ring explicitly references the concept of a ring, stating that a ring 'R' is called Noetherian if it satisfies certain properties regarding its ideals. The properties and structure of ideals are inherently linked to the underlying ring structure, as ideals are subsets of rings that are closed under the ring operations and absorb multiplication by elements of the ring. Therefore, understanding what a ring is, including its operations and elements, is crucial to defining what an ideal is and, subsequently, what it means for a ring to be Noetherian. Without the concept of a ring, the definition of a Noetherian ring would lack the necessary context for the terms and operations it uses, such as ideals, addition, and multiplication.",
