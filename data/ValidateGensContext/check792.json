                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of the 'Degree of a Field Extension' to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of the 'Degree of a Field Extension' involves the concept of a vector space dimension, specifically $[L: K] := \\operatorname{dim}_{K} L$, where $L$ and $K$ are fields, and $K \\subset L$ indicates that $K$ is a subset of $L$.\\n\\n2. The concept of a vector space requires the notion of elements, as a vector space over a field $K$ is defined as a set of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by elements of $K$.\\n\\n3. The dimension of a vector space, in this context $\\operatorname{dim}_{K} L$, is defined as the number of vectors in a basis of the vector space $L$ over the field $K$. Each vector in this basis is an element of the set $L$.\\n\\n4. Therefore, understanding and defining what an 'element' is, is crucial because the vectors (elements of $L$) and the scalars (elements of $K$) are fundamental in forming the vector space structure and in defining its dimension.\\n\\n5. Without the concept of an 'Element of a Set', we cannot properly define what it means for $K$ to be a subset of $L$, nor can we discuss the elements that compose the vector spaces and their bases, which are essential in calculating the dimension $[L: K]$.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is indeed necessary for the definition of the 'Degree of a Field Extension' to make sense, as it underpins the fundamental structures (sets and vector spaces) involved in the definition.",
