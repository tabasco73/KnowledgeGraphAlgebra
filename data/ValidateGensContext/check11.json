The factor ring, or residue class ring, $R / \\mathfrak{a}$, is defined initially as an abelian group by viewing $\\mathfrak{a}$ as a (normal) subgroup of the additive group of $R$. The elements of $R / \\mathfrak{a}$ are all residue classes of type $x+\\mathfrak{a}$ for $x \\in R$, where addition is given by $(x+\\mathfrak{a})+(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x+y)+\\mathfrak{a}$ and multiplication by $(x+\\mathfrak{a}) \\cdot(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x \\cdot y)+\\mathfrak{a}$. The ring properties of $R$ carry over to $R / \\mathfrak{a}$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Factor Ring involves defining operations (addition and multiplication) on the set of residue classes $R / \\mathfrak{a}$. These operations are defined by $(x+\\mathfrak{a})+(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x+y)+\\mathfrak{a}$ and $(x+\\mathfrak{a}) \\cdot(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x \\cdot y)+\\mathfrak{a}$. These operations are examples of laws of composition, as they map pairs of elements from $R / \\mathfrak{a} \\times R / \\mathfrak{a}$ to $R / \\mathfrak{a}$. Therefore, the concept of a law of composition is inherently used in defining the operations within a factor ring. Without the concept of a law of composition, the operations that make $R / \\mathfrak{a}$ a ring (i.e., addition and multiplication) would not be properly defined, making the concept of a factor ring incomplete or nonsensical.",
