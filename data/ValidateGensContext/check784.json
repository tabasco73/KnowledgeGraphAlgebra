                "Explanation": "The definition of a splitting field of a family of polynomials explicitly requires the concept of a field extension. According to the definition, a splitting field \\(L\\) of a family of polynomials \\(\\mathfrak{F}\\) over a field \\(K\\) is described as a field extending \\(K\\). This directly implies that \\(L\\) is a field extension of \\(K\\), as it must include \\(K\\) as a subfield and extend beyond it to include additional elements (specifically, the zeros of the polynomials in \\(\\mathfrak{F}\\)). Therefore, the concept of a field extension is inherently necessary to define what a splitting field is, as the relationship between \\(K\\) and \\(L\\) as a field extension is central to the concept of a splitting field.",
