More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Left Coset explicitly requires the existence of a group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ of $G$. A left coset is defined as a subset of $G$ formed by multiplying a fixed element $a$ from $G$ with every element of the subgroup $H$. This operation and the structure of the coset are dependent on the properties of the group, such as the existence of a binary operation and the associative property. Without the concept of a group, the operations and the structure described in the definition of a left coset would not have a meaningful context, as there would be no defined binary operation or associative property to rely on. Therefore, the concept of a group is essential for the definition of a left coset to make sense.",
