                "Explanation": "The concept of the length of an A-module, as defined, involves the existence of a chain of submodules of increasing order until the entire module is reached. This definition focuses on the structure of submodules within the module and does not inherently require the module to be free or to have a basis. The length of an A-module is a measure of the complexity of its submodule structure, irrespective of whether the module has a basis or not.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a free A-module is defined as having a basis, which allows every element of the module to be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of basis elements. This definition pertains to the type of generators the module has and does not directly influence the concept of length, which is more concerned with the hierarchical structure of submodules.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a free A-module is not necessary for the definition or understanding of the length of an A-module. The length can be defined and understood entirely within the context of submodule chains without reference to whether the module is free or not.",
