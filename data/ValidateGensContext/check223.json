                "Explanation": "The definition of a p-Sylow subgroup inherently relies on the concept of the order of a group. Specifically, the definition states that a subgroup H of a finite group G is a p-Sylow subgroup if it is a p-group such that p does not divide the index (G: H). The index (G: H) is calculated as the quotient of the orders of G and H, i.e., ord G / ord H. Furthermore, the definition explicitly uses the orders of H and G, expressed as ord H = p^k and ord G = p^k m, where p does not divide m. Without the concept of the order of a group, these expressions and the condition that p does not divide the index (G: H) would not make sense, as they depend on knowing the number of elements in each group (or subgroup). Therefore, the concept of the order of a group is essential for defining a p-Sylow subgroup.",
