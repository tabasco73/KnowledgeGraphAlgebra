            "Let $G$ be a monoid. A subset $H \\subset G$ is called a submonoid if $H$ satisfies the following conditions: (i) $e \\in H$, (ii) $a, b \\in H \\Longrightarrow a b \\in H$. If $G$ is a group, $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if in addition, (iii) $a \\in H \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\in H$. In particular, a subgroup of a group $G$ is a submonoid that is closed under the process of taking inverses. In defining a subgroup $H \\subset G$, condition (i) can be weakened by simply requiring $H \\neq \\emptyset$, since this implies $e \\in H$ using (ii) and (iii). Of course, similar reasoning is not possible for monoids. Every group $G$ admits $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ as trivial subgroups. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the set $m \\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integral multiples of $m$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}$. We will see in 1.3/4 that all subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of this type. More generally, every element $a$ of a group $G$ gives rise to a so-called cyclic subgroup of $G$. It consists of all powers $a^{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where we put $a^{n}=\\left(a^{-1}\\right)^{-n}$ for $n<0; see also Section 1.3."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a group homomorphism involves a function between two groups that preserves the group operation and the identity element. It requires that the function maps the identity element of one group to the identity of another and that the product of any two elements in the first group is mapped to the product of their images in the second group. This definition focuses solely on the properties of the function between two groups and does not inherently require the concept of a subgroup.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a subgroup pertains to a subset of a group that itself forms a group under the same operation as the larger group. This includes the presence of the identity element, closure under the group operation, and the existence of inverses for all elements in the subset.\\n\\nThe definition of a group homomorphism does not depend on or require the existence of subgroups within either group. It is solely concerned with the properties of a function between two entire groups, not subsets of these groups. Therefore, the concept of a subgroup is not necessary for the definition of a group homomorphism to make sense.",
