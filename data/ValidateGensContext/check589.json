                "Explanation": "The definition of the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field explicitly states that it is cyclic of order $q-1$. This statement inherently relies on the concept of the order of a group, which is defined as the number of elements in the group. Therefore, understanding the order of the group is essential to comprehend the structure and properties of the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field. Without the concept of the order of a group, one would not be able to specify that the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field has $q-1$ elements, which is a critical aspect of its definition and characterization.",
