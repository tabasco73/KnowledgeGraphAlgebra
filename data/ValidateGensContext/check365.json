                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Polynomial is necessary for defining a Splitting Field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Splitting Field specifically references a polynomial, in this case, $X^q-X$. The definition states that a field $\\mathbb{F}$ is a splitting field of this polynomial if it factorizes into linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}$, and contains all zeros of the polynomial.\\n\\n2. Understanding what it means for a polynomial to factorize into linear factors and to contain zeros of a polynomial inherently requires understanding what a polynomial is. The definition of a polynomial as a formal sum $f=\\sum_{j=0}^{n} a_{j} X^{j}$ provides the necessary framework to discuss factorization and zeros.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a polynomial, terms like 'factorizes', 'linear factors', and 'zeros' lose their meaning because they are properties and behaviors specifically associated with polynomials.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a Polynomial is essential for defining and understanding what a Splitting Field of a polynomial is, as the entire definition of a Splitting Field revolves around the behavior of a polynomial within a certain field.",
