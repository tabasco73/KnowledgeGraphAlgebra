                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Field is necessary for the definition of a Separable Polynomial, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a Separable Polynomial. The definition states that a separable polynomial is one that has distinct roots in its splitting field. A splitting field is a field extension of a given field over which a polynomial splits into linear factors (i.e., it becomes a product of linear polynomials). This concept inherently requires the notion of a field because the splitting field itself must be a field. Without the concept of a field, the idea of a splitting field cannot exist, and thus the definition of a separable polynomial, which relies on the existence of distinct roots in this splitting field, would not make sense. Therefore, the concept of a Field is necessary to properly define what a Separable Polynomial is.",
