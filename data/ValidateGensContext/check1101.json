A torsion element is defined solely based on the existence of an element a in the ring A (excluding zero) such that the product of a and the element x in the module M equals zero. This definition focuses on individual elements of the module and their interaction with elements of the ring A.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a submodule is a subset of a module that itself forms a module under the same operations. The definition of a submodule involves understanding subsets and closure properties but does not directly impact the definition of a torsion element. The concept of a torsion element can be fully understood and applied without any reference to submodules. Therefore, the concept of a submodule is not necessary for the definition of a torsion element to make sense.",
