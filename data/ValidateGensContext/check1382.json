                "Explanation": "The definition of an Integral Domain explicitly states that it is a type of commutative ring which is nonzero and does not have nontrivial zero divisors. This means that the concept of a commutative ring is fundamental to understanding what an integral domain is. Without the concept of a commutative ring, the definition of an integral domain would lack the necessary context to make sense, as it specifically refers to properties that a commutative ring must or must not have (e.g., commutativity of multiplication, absence of nontrivial zero divisors). Therefore, the concept of a commutative ring is essential and must be defined first for the definition of an integral domain to be meaningful and complete.",
