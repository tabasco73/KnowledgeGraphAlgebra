                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of an Integral Domain is necessary for the definition of an Extension Field to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions and relationships between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Extension Field**: An extension field $\\mathbb{F}_q / \\mathbb{F}_p$ is defined as a field with $q=p^n$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number and $n$ is a positive integer. This field is a splitting field of the polynomial $X^q-X$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. The definition inherently assumes that $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is a field, which is a special kind of ring that is both commutative and has no zero divisors, and every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Integral Domain**: An integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors and is nonzero. This definition is less restrictive than that of a field, which additionally requires every nonzero element to have a multiplicative inverse.\\n\\n3. **Relationship and Necessity**: The definition of an extension field does not explicitly require the concept of an integral domain. It directly builds upon the properties of fields. While integral domains and fields share some properties (like being commutative and having no zero divisors), the specific properties of fields used in defining extension fields (like the existence of multiplicative inverses for all nonzero elements) are not covered by the mere definition of integral domains.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: The concept of an integral domain is not necessary for the definition of an extension field. The definition of an extension field relies on the properties of fields, which are a subset of rings with additional properties not necessarily shared by all integral domains.",
