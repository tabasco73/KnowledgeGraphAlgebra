                "Explanation": "The concept of a Principal Ideal pertains to ring theory, specifically dealing with ideals within rings. It involves the creation of an ideal from a single element within a ring, focusing on the structure and properties of rings.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Splitting Field of a Family of Polynomials is a concept from field theory, particularly in the context of polynomial factorization and field extensions. It involves finding a field extension where a given set of polynomials can be completely factored into linear factors, and this extension is generated by the roots of these polynomials.\\n\\nThere is no inherent dependency between the concept of a Principal Ideal and the definition or understanding of a Splitting Field. The definition of a Splitting Field involves field extensions and polynomial factorization, which are independent of the concept of ideals in ring theory. Therefore, understanding or defining a Splitting Field does not require the concept of a Principal Ideal.",
