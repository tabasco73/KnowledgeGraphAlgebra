                "Explanation": "The definition of a Primitive Polynomial requires the polynomial to be in $R[X]$, where $R$ is a unique factorization domain (UFD). A UFD is a specific type of integral domain, which in turn is a specific type of commutative ring with unity. Therefore, the concept of a commutative ring is foundational to defining a UFD. Since the definition of a Primitive Polynomial relies on the ring $R$ being a UFD, it indirectly requires $R$ to be a commutative ring. Thus, understanding and defining a commutative ring is necessary before one can fully understand and define what constitutes a Primitive Polynomial.",
