                "Explanation": "The concept of a Dedekind domain focuses on the unique factorization of ideals, not elements. In a Dedekind domain, every ideal (except zero and the whole ring) can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime ideals. This property is a generalization of the unique factorization of elements into irreducibles, which is characteristic of principal ideal domains (a subset of Dedekind domains).\\n\\nThe concept of an irreducible element, on the other hand, pertains to the factorization of elements within an integral domain. An element is irreducible if it cannot be factored into a product of two non-units in the domain. While the notion of irreducible elements is fundamental in the study of factorization in integral domains, it is not directly necessary for defining a Dedekind domain. The key property of Dedekind domains is about ideals, not individual elements.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of irreducible elements is not necessary for the definition of a Dedekind domain. The definition and understanding of Dedekind domains can be fully established based on the properties of ideals alone, without reference to the irreducibility of elements.",
