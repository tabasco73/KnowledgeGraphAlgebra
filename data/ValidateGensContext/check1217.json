                "Explanation": "Kronecker's construction involves the creation of an extension field by taking the quotient of the polynomial ring of a base field by the ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. This process inherently requires the concept of a polynomial, as it directly uses a polynomial (the irreducible polynomial) and the polynomial ring (which is a ring composed of polynomials). Without the concept of a polynomial, the terms 'polynomial ring' and 'irreducible polynomial' used in the definition of Kronecker's construction would not have meaning, making the concept of a polynomial essential for understanding and defining Kronecker's construction.",
