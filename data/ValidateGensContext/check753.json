                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of 'Powers of an Element' is necessary for the definition of a 'Subgroup generated by a set', we need to analyze the components of each definition.\\n\\n1. The definition of 'Subgroup generated by a set' involves expressions of the form $x_{1}^{\\varepsilon_{1}} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_{n}^{\\varepsilon_{n}}$, where $x_i$ are elements of the subset $X$ and $\\varepsilon_i$ are either 1 or -1. This indicates that elements of the subgroup are formed by taking products of powers of elements of $X$.\\n\\n2. The concept of 'Powers of an Element' specifically defines what it means to raise an element to a power, including negative powers (implied by the existence of inverses in the group context) and the identity element (power zero).\\n\\n3. The subgroup definition relies on being able to express elements as products of powers of other elements. Without the concept of 'Powers of an Element', we would not have a formal way to interpret expressions like $x^1$ or $x^{-1}$, which are crucial for constructing all possible elements of the subgroup generated by $X$.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of 'Powers of an Element' is essential for the definition of 'Subgroup generated by a set' because it provides the necessary framework for understanding and constructing the elements of the subgroup as powers of elements of $X$.",
