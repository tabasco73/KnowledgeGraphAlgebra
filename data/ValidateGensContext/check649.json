In this context, the focus is on the behavior of polynomials and their roots in the extension field.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Zero Divisor pertains to ring theory, where it describes elements within a ring that can nullify other non-zero elements under multiplication. Importantly, in the context of fields, which are a special kind of ring, there are no zero divisors other than zero itself. This is because every non-zero element in a field has a multiplicative inverse, ensuring that no non-zero product can result in zero.\\n\\nGiven that purely inseparable extensions are discussed within the framework of fields, and fields inherently do not have zero divisors (other than zero), the concept of zero divisors is irrelevant to the definition or understanding of purely inseparable extensions. The properties and definitions of purely inseparable extensions can be fully understood without reference to zero divisors.",
