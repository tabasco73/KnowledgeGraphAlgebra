            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of a Subring, we need to analyze the requirements of a Subring. According to the provided definition, a Subring is a subset S of a ring R that is a subgroup with respect to the addition on R and a submonoid with respect to the multiplication on R. This definition explicitly uses the term 'subgroup', which is derived from the concept of a Group. A subgroup is a subset of a group that itself forms a group under the operation inherited from the larger group. Therefore, understanding what a subgroup is necessitates understanding what a group is, as the properties and structure of a group (associativity, identity element, and inverses) are fundamental to defining a subgroup. Without the concept of a Group, the notion of a subgroup would be undefined, and consequently, the definition of a Subring, which relies on the concept of a subgroup, would be incomplete or nonsensical.",
