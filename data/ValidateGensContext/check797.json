(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of an Ideal explicitly requires the concept of a Ring. According to the definition provided, an Ideal is a subset of a Ring that satisfies certain properties. Without the concept of a Ring, the definition of an Ideal cannot be established because it relies on the structure and operations (addition and multiplication) defined within a Ring. The properties that define an Ideal, such as being an additive subgroup and closure under multiplication by elements from the Ring, are inherently tied to the operations and elements of a Ring. Therefore, the concept of a Ring is essential and must be defined before one can define what an Ideal is within that context.",
