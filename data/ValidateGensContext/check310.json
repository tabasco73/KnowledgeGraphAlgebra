                "Explanation": "The concept of a 'System of generators' is defined independently of the concept of a 'Finitely Generated Ideal'. The definition of a system of generators involves any family of elements in an A-module M that can generate M through their linear combinations with coefficients in A. This definition does not inherently require the ideal to be finitely generated; it only specifies that the module can be generated by some set of elements, regardless of the size of this set.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a 'Finitely Generated Ideal' specifically pertains to ideals in a ring and requires that the ideal can be generated by a finite number of elements. This is a specific case of the broader concept of a system of generators, where the system is finite and the module is an ideal in a ring.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a system of generators does not depend on the concept of a finitely generated ideal. It is a more general concept that applies to any module and does not necessitate the finiteness of the generating set.",
