                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field of Fractions is defined for an integral domain $R$ and involves creating a field from the elements of $R$ where each element of the field is an equivalence class of pairs $(a, b)$, with $a, b \\text{ in } R$ and $b \\neq 0$. The equivalence relation used is $(a, b) \\sim (a', b')$ if $ab' = a'b$. This definition focuses on the properties of elements in $R$ and their ability to form fractions that behave like rational numbers.\\n\\nThe concept of a Maximal Ideal involves a proper ideal $\\text{\\mathfrak{m}} \\subsetneq R$ in a ring $R$ that is maximal in the sense that any larger ideal must be the entire ring $R$. This concept is related to the structure of ideals within the ring but does not directly influence the ability of the ring to form a field of fractions.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and construction of a Field of Fractions do not rely on the concept of Maximal Ideals. The Field of Fractions can be defined and understood purely in terms of the elements of $R$ and their properties without reference to the maximal ideals of $R$.",
