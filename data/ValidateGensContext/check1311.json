                "Explanation": "The concept of a Splitting Field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield involves understanding fields, polynomials, and their roots. A splitting field is essentially a field extension containing all roots of the polynomial, where the polynomial splits into linear factors. This concept is purely algebraic, focusing on properties of fields and polynomials.\\n\\nThe Cartesian Product, on the other hand, is a concept from set theory that defines the set of all ordered pairs (or tuples, for more than two sets) from given sets. It is used to construct new sets from existing ones and is fundamental in defining relations, functions, and product spaces in mathematics.\\n\\nConnecting these two concepts, the definition and understanding of a splitting field do not require the concept of the Cartesian product. The splitting field's definition and properties can be fully understood and analyzed using field theory and polynomial algebra without any need to refer to or use the Cartesian product. Therefore, the Cartesian product is not necessary for defining or understanding a splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield.",
