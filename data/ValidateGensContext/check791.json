                "Explanation": "To understand whether a separable polynomial can be defined without the concept of a polynomial, we need to analyze the dependency of the definitions. The definition of a separable polynomial explicitly states that it is a type of polynomial, specifically one that has distinct roots in its splitting field. This implies that the concept of a polynomial is fundamental to defining what a separable polynomial is. Without understanding what a polynomial is, one cannot comprehend the meaning of having distinct roots or even the structure of the polynomial itself. Therefore, the concept of a polynomial is essential and foundational for the definition of a separable polynomial to make sense.",
