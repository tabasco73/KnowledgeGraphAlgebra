According to the provided definition, a submodule of an A-module M is a subset that is closed under the operations of M. This definition explicitly uses the term 'subset,' indicating that the concept of a submodule inherently relies on the concept of a subset. A submodule must first be a subset of M before it can satisfy additional properties (like being closed under the operations of M). Therefore, understanding what a subset is becomes crucial to understanding what a submodule is. Without the concept of a subset, the definition of a submodule would be incomplete and unclear, as it would lack the foundational idea of being a part of a larger set (M) while adhering to specific structural properties.",
