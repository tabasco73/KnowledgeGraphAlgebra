                "Explanation": "The concept of a Dihedral Group involves defining a group of symmetries of a regular polygon, which includes operations such as rotations and reflections. These operations can be represented by permutations, and the group is generated by specific permutations. A group, by definition, includes a set along with a binary operation (law of composition) that combines any two elements of the set to form another element of the set. This operation must satisfy certain properties such as associativity, identity, and inverses.\\n\\nIn the case of the dihedral group, the law of composition is crucial as it defines how the elements of the group (the permutations) interact with each other. This interaction is what forms the group structure. Without a law of composition, it would not be possible to discuss the group structure because there would be no defined way to 'combine' elements of the set. Therefore, the concept of a law of composition is necessary for the definition of a dihedral group to make sense, as it provides the framework within which the group operations (permutations representing rotations and reflections) are defined and understood.",
