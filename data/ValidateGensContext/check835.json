                "Explanation": "The definition of a subring focuses on a subset S of a ring R that itself forms a ring under the same operations as R. It requires that S be closed under addition and multiplication and contain the additive identity of R. This definition is self-contained and does not rely on the concept of mappings between different rings or the bijectivity of such mappings.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a ring isomorphism involves a bijective homomorphism between two rings, ensuring an exact correspondence in structure and elements between them. This concept is crucial when discussing the equivalence of rings but is not necessary for defining what constitutes a subring within a given ring.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a ring isomorphism is not required to understand or define a subring. The definition of a subring can be fully understood and applied without reference to ring isomorphisms, as it pertains solely to the internal structure and properties of a subset within a single ring.",
