                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Law of Composition needs to be defined for the definition of an Ideal to make sense, we need to analyze the requirements of the definition of an Ideal:\\n\\n1. An Ideal $\\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\)$ in a ring $\\(R\\)$ is defined as a subset that is an additive subgroup of $\\(R\\)$. This implies the existence of an addition operation within $\\(R\\)$, which is a specific type of law of composition (additive).\\n\\n2. The definition further requires that for any $\\(r \\in R\\)$ and $\\(a \\in \\mathfrak{a}\\)$, the product $\\(ra\\)$ must also be in $\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\)$. This product operation is another law of composition (multiplicative).\\n\\nThus, the definition of an Ideal inherently relies on the existence of two types of laws of composition: addition and multiplication. These operations must be well-defined for the concept of an Ideal to be meaningful, as they are essential to satisfying the conditions that define an Ideal.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of an Ideal to make sense, as it provides the framework for the operations (addition and multiplication) that are fundamental to the structure and properties of an Ideal in a ring.",
