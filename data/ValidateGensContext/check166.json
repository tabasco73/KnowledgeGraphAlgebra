                "Explanation": "The concept of a Factorial ring or unique factorization domain (UFD) focuses on the properties of elements within a single ring, specifically their factorization into irreducibles or primes. The definition of a UFD involves conditions that apply internally to the ring itself, such as every non-zero non-unit element being expressible uniquely as a product of irreducible elements, and these irreducibles being prime.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Ring Extension involves the relationship between two rings, where one ring is a subring of another. This concept is used to study properties that might change or be inherited when moving from a smaller ring (subring) to a larger ring.\\n\\nGiven these definitions, the concept of a Ring Extension is not necessary to define or understand a Factorial ring/UFD. The definition and properties of a UFD can be fully understood and applied without reference to another ring or a subring relationship, as it pertains solely to the internal structure and properties of the ring itself.",
