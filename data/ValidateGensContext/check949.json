More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a group inherently relies on the concept of a set and its elements. A group is defined as a set G with a specific law of composition. This law of composition operates on elements of the set G, and properties such as associativity, the existence of a unit element, and the existence of inverses are all defined in terms of these elements. Therefore, understanding what an element of a set is becomes crucial for defining what a group is. Without the concept of elements of a set, the operations and properties that characterize a group cannot be properly defined or understood. Thus, the concept of an element of a set is necessary for the definition of a group to make sense.",
