                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a field is necessary for the definition of a purely inseparable extension, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a purely inseparable extension. The definition states that it is a field extension where the minimal polynomial of any element in the extension has a single root, repeated according to the degree of the polynomial. A field extension inherently involves two fields: a larger field (the extension) and a smaller field (the base). The concept of minimal polynomials, which are used in the definition, also relies on the properties of fields, specifically the ability to perform division and the commutative property of addition and multiplication, which are essential for defining polynomials and their roots. Therefore, the concept of a field is fundamental to defining what a field extension is, and by extension, what a purely inseparable extension is. Without the concept of a field, the terms 'field extension' and 'minimal polynomial' would not have a meaningful context, making the definition of a purely inseparable extension nonsensical.",
