                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Noetherian ring, we need to analyze the components of each definition and their interdependencies.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Noetherian ring involves the concept of a ring, ideals, and chains of ideals. A ring, by definition, includes two operations: addition and multiplication. These operations are examples of laws of composition because they map pairs of elements from the ring to another element in the ring (i.e., they take $(a, b) \\rightarrow a + b$ and $(a, b) \\rightarrow a \\times b$).\\n\\n2. The Law of Composition is explicitly required to define the operations within a ring. Without such laws, the structure of a ring, including the ability to form and manipulate ideals (which are subsets closed under these operations), would not be well-defined.\\n\\n3. Since the definition of a Noetherian ring relies on the structure of a ring and the behavior of its ideals, and since a ring inherently requires laws of composition to define its arithmetic operations, the concept of a Law of Composition is indeed necessary for the definition of a Noetherian ring to make sense.",
