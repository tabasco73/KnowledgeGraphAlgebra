                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Set is needed for the definition of a Separable extension to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a Separable extension. The definition states that an extension $L / K$ is called separable if it does not contain any inseparable algebraic elements over $K$. Here, $L$ and $K$ are typically fields, which are themselves sets with additional structure (algebraic operations that satisfy certain properties). The notion of 'extension' in this context refers to $L$ being a field that includes $K$ and possibly additional elements, forming a larger set. The concept of algebraic elements also inherently involves sets, as these elements are from the set that forms the field $L$. Thus, understanding and defining fields, extensions, and algebraic elements fundamentally relies on the concept of sets, as each of these is a set or a collection of sets with additional structure. Therefore, the concept of a Set is necessary to properly define what an extension $L / K$ is, and consequently, to define what a Separable extension is.",
