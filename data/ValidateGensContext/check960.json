More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

This concept is purely set-theoretic and pertains to the behavior of functions between sets.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Group involves algebraic structures with specific properties like associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverses for every element. These properties are related to operations within the set that define the group structure.\\n\\nThere is no inherent need for the algebraic structure of a group (or any of its specific properties like inverses or identity elements) to define or understand the image of a map. The definition of the image of a map is independent of any algebraic operations that might exist on the elements of the sets involved; it solely depends on the existence of a function and its mapping properties.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Group is not necessary to define or understand the concept of the Image of a Map.",
