                "Explanation": "The concept of a Finitely Generated Field Extension involves a field extension $K \\subset L$ where $L$ can be generated by finitely many elements from $K$. This concept inherently relies on the properties of fields and field extensions, which are specific types of rings with additional properties (like the existence of multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements).\\n\\nThe concept of a Commutative Ring, on the other hand, is a broader concept in algebra that defines a ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. While all fields are commutative rings, the definition of a field and a field extension does not rely on the general concept of a commutative ring but rather on the specific properties of fields themselves.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding or defining a Finitely Generated Field Extension does not require the concept of a Commutative Ring to be defined first. The definition of a field and field extension provides all necessary properties (including commutativity of multiplication) to discuss finitely generated extensions without referencing the broader category of commutative rings.",
