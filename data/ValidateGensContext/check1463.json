                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a 'Set' needs to be defined for the definition of a 'Subset' to make sense, we can analyze the given definitions:\\n\\n1. The definition of a 'Subset' states that it is a set where all of its elements are also contained within another set. This definition inherently uses the concept of a 'set' twice: first to define the subset itself, and second to refer to the other set that contains its elements.\\n\\n2. The definition of a 'Set' is a collection of distinct objects considered as an entity. This definition establishes what a set is, which is fundamental to understanding what it means for one set to contain another set or for elements to belong to a set.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the definition of a 'Subset' relies on the understanding of what a 'Set' is. Without the concept of a 'Set', the definition of a 'Subset' would lack context and clarity because it would not be clear what kind of entity a 'subset' is or what it means for one such entity to contain elements of another similar entity.",
