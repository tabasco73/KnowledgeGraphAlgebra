                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Division Ring is necessary for defining an Algebraic Field Extension, we need to analyze the definitions and relationships between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Algebraic Field Extension**: An extension field $L$ over a field $K$ is algebraic if every element in $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This means each element $\\beta$ in $L$ satisfies some polynomial equation with coefficients in $K$ where the leading coefficient is non-zero.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Division Ring**: A division ring is a ring in which every non-zero element is invertible, but it does not necessarily have to be commutative.\\n\\n3. **Relationship between Fields and Division Rings**: While every field is a division ring (since every non-zero element in a field is invertible and fields are commutative), not every division ring is a field due to the possible lack of commutativity.\\n\\n4. **Necessity for Algebraic Field Extension**: The definition of an algebraic field extension specifically involves fields (both $K$ and $L$ are fields). The properties of being a division ring (like invertibility of non-zero elements) are inherent in fields but the non-commutativity allowed in division rings is not relevant to the definition of field extensions, which are inherently about fields (which are commutative).\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that understanding or defining a division ring is not necessary for the concept of an algebraic field extension. The essential properties used in defining an algebraic field extension are those of fields, not the broader category of division rings which includes non-commutative structures.",
