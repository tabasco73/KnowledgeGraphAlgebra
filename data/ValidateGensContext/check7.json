                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Field needs to be defined for the concept of an Extension Field to make sense, we need to analyze the relationship between these two concepts based on their definitions.\\n\\n1. The definition of an Extension Field refers to it as a field that consists of a certain number of elements, specifically $q=p^n$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number and $n$ is a positive integer. This definition inherently assumes the existence and understanding of what a field is, as it describes the extension field in terms of being a field itself.\\n\\n2. Furthermore, the definition of an Extension Field mentions that it is characterized as a splitting field of a certain polynomial over another field, $\\mathbb{F}_p$. This again presupposes knowledge of what a field is, since $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is described as a field.\\n\\n3. The definition of a Field as a commutative division ring provides the fundamental properties and structure that are assumed in the definition of an Extension Field. Without understanding what a field is, the concept of an extension field would lack the necessary foundational context, making it difficult to comprehend or apply.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Field must be defined and understood for the concept of an Extension Field to be meaningful and coherent.",
