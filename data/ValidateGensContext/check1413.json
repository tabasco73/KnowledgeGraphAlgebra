                "Explanation": "The concept of the minimal polynomial involves finding a polynomial in the base field that has a specific element from a field extension as a root. This definition focuses on the properties of polynomials and their roots in relation to field extensions, but does not inherently involve the characteristic of the field. The characteristic of a field, defined as the number of times the unit element must be added to itself to yield zero, primarily affects the structure and arithmetic within the field itself. While the characteristic can influence the behavior of polynomials over a field (e.g., in fields of characteristic p, (x+y)^p = x^p + y^p), it is not a prerequisite for defining or understanding the concept of a minimal polynomial. The minimal polynomial can be defined and studied without direct reference to the field's characteristic, as it primarily concerns the degrees and roots of polynomials rather than the underlying arithmetic of the field.",
