If $G$ is a group, $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if in addition, (iii) $a \\in H \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\in H$. In particular, a subgroup of a group $G$ is a submonoid that is closed under the process of taking inverses. In defining a subgroup $H \\subset G$, condition (i) can be weakened by simply requiring $H \\neq \\emptyset$, since this implies $e \\in H$ using (ii) and (iii). Of course, similar reasoning is not possible for monoids. Every group $G$ admits $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ as trivial subgroups. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the set $m \\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integral multiples of $m$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}$. We will see in 1.3/4 that all subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of this type. More generally, every element $a$ of a group $G$ gives rise to a so-called cyclic subgroup of $G$. It consists of all powers $a^{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where we put $a^{n}=\\left(a^{-1}\\right)^{-n}$ for $n<0; see also Section 1.3."

                "Explanation": "The definition of the Klein Four-Group explicitly states that it is a subgroup of the symmetric group \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{4}\\\\). To understand this statement, one must know what a subgroup is. The concept of a subgroup involves certain properties that a subset of a group must satisfy to qualify as a subgroup, including closure under group operation and the existence of inverses for all elements. Without understanding these properties, one cannot fully grasp why the Klein Four-Group, with its specific elements, qualifies as a subgroup of \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{4}\\\\). Therefore, the concept of a subgroup is essential for defining the Klein Four-Group, as it provides the necessary framework to understand the group structure and properties of \\\\(\\mathfrak{V}_{4}\\\\).",
