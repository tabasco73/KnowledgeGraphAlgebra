                "Explanation": "The definition of a ring homomorphism involves a map between two rings that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication). This definition requires only the concept of a ring and does not specifically require the concept of a polynomial ring. A polynomial ring is a specific type of ring constructed from another ring, but the general concept of a ring homomorphism applies to any rings, not just polynomial rings. Therefore, the concept of a polynomial ring is not necessary for the definition of a ring homomorphism to make sense. The definition of a ring homomorphism is valid as long as the objects involved are rings, regardless of whether they are polynomial rings or any other type of rings.",
