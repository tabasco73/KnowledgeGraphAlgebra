                "Explanation": "The concept of a subgroup generated by a set is defined within the context of group theory, specifically referring to a group $G$ and a subset $X$ of $G$. The definition involves the intersection of all subgroups of $G$ that contain $X$, and the elements of the subgroup are generated by finite combinations of elements from $X$ and their inverses. This definition inherently relies on the properties of a group, including the existence of an inverse for each element and the associative property of the group operation.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a monoid is a more general algebraic structure that includes an associative binary operation and a unit element, but does not necessarily include inverses for every element. The concept of a monoid is broader and less restrictive compared to that of a group.\\n\\nGiven that the definition of a subgroup generated by a set specifically requires the structure of a group (which is a more specific structure than a monoid), the concept of a monoid is not necessary for the definition of a subgroup generated by a set. The essential properties needed for defining a subgroup generated by a set are those of a group, not just any monoid. Therefore, the concept of a monoid does not need to be defined for the definition of a subgroup generated by a set to make sense.",
