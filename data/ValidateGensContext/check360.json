The definition states that a field extension $K \\subset L$ is simple if there exists an element $\\alpha \\in L$ such that $L=K(\\alpha)$. This definition involves the concept of fields, elements of fields, and the generation of a field extension by an element. It does not explicitly involve any mapping or function between sets. The concept of a field extension and the generation of a field by an element do not inherently require the definition or use of a map or function as described in the provided definition of a Map/Function. Therefore, the concept of a Map/Function is not necessary to understand or define a Simple Field Extension as per the given definitions.",
