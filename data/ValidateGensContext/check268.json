                "Explanation": "The concept of a purely inseparable extension involves the properties of field extensions and minimal polynomials. In the context of field theory, a field is inherently a commutative ring under addition and multiplication. This means that the commutative law (i.e., $ab = ba$ for all $a, b$ in the field) is already a fundamental property of the fields being discussed when defining a purely inseparable extension.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a purely inseparable extension does not require the explicit definition of the commutative law, as the commutativity of the field operations is a given in the context of field theory. The focus of the definition of a purely inseparable extension is on the nature of the roots of the minimal polynomials, not on the commutativity of the operations in the field, which is assumed.",
