                "Explanation": "To define a Field of Fractions, we start with an integral domain $R$. The field of fractions $Q(R)$ is described as the set of equivalence classes of pairs $(a, b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are elements of $R$ and $b$ is not zero. The concept of equivalence classes inherently relies on the notion of a set, as each equivalence class is a subset of the Cartesian product $R \\times R$. Furthermore, the definition of $Q(R)$ as a collection of these equivalence classes directly uses the concept of a set. Therefore, understanding and defining what a set is becomes crucial to structuring and comprehending the field of fractions. Without the concept of a set, the notion of collecting objects into equivalence classes and considering them as a unified entity (which is essential in defining $Q(R)$) would not be possible.",
