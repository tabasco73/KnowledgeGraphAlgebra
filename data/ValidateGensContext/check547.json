                "Explanation": "The concept of a Factor Group is based on the structure of a group, specifically involving a normal subgroup and the set of its cosets. The definition of a group inherently includes the properties of a monoid, as a group is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element, which are the defining properties of a monoid. However, the concept of a monoid itself does not need to be explicitly defined or used to define a factor group. The definition of a factor group relies on the properties of groups (associativity, identity, and inverses) and normal subgroups, but it does not directly depend on the concept of a monoid. While a group is a special type of monoid, the specific properties of groups that are not shared with all monoids (like the existence of inverses for every element) are crucial for defining a factor group. Therefore, the concept of a monoid is not necessary for the definition of a factor group to make sense.",
