                "Explanation": "The concept of a Minimal Polynomial inherently involves a field extension, as seen in the provided definitions. A field extension is a specific type of ring extension where both the larger ring (field) and the smaller ring (subfield) are fields. The definition of a Minimal Polynomial requires a field extension (e.g., $K \\\\< L$) and does not merely involve any ring extension. The minimal polynomial is defined specifically for elements that are algebraic over a base field within the context of a field extension, not just any ring extension. Therefore, while the concept of a ring extension is related (since field extensions are a special case of ring extensions), the specific concept needed to define a minimal polynomial is that of a field extension, not just any ring extension.",
