                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a normal subgroup is necessary for the definition of a solvable group, we need to analyze the requirements of the definition of a solvable group. According to the provided definition, a group $G$ is solvable if there exists a chain of subgroups $G_{0} \\supsetneq G_{1} \\supsetneq \\ldots \\supsetneq G_{r}=\\{1\\}$ where each $G_{i+1}$ is a normal subgroup of $G_{i}$, and the quotient group $G_{i} / G_{i+1}$ is abelian. The concept of a normal subgroup is explicitly used here as it is required that each $G_{i+1}$ be a normal subgroup of $G_{i}$. This condition is crucial because it ensures that the quotient group $G_{i} / G_{i+1}$ is well-defined and that it can be abelian. Without the normality condition, the quotient group might not even be a group, which would make it impossible to check if it is abelian. Therefore, the concept of a normal subgroup is essential for the definition of a solvable group to make sense.",
