                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Ideal needs to be defined for the definition of a Finitely Generated Ideal to make sense, we need to analyze the dependency of the latter on the former.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Finitely Generated Ideal states that an ideal \\\\(\\n\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) in a ring \\\\(\\nR\\\\) is finitely generated if it admits a finite system of generators. This definition inherently assumes the existence of an ideal \\\\(\\n\\mathfrak{a}\\\\), but does not explicitly define what an ideal is.\\n\\n2. The concept of an Ideal is defined as a subset \\\\(\\n\\mathfrak{a} \\\\subset R\\\\) that is an additive subgroup of \\\\(\\nR\\\\) and satisfies the property that for any \\\\(\\nr \\\\in R\\\\) and \\\\(\\na \\\\in \\mathfrak{a}\\\\), \\\\(\\nra \\\\in \\mathfrak{a}\\\\).\\n\\n3. Without the definition of an Ideal, the term 'ideal' in the definition of a Finitely Generated Ideal would be ambiguous and unclear. The properties and structure of an ideal are crucial to understanding what it means for such a subset to be finitally generated.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the definition of an Ideal provides the necessary context and foundational concepts that make the definition of a Finitely Generated Ideal comprehensible and meaningful.",
