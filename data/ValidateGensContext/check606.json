                "Explanation": "The concept of a Simple Field Extension involves a field extension $K \\subset L$ where $L$ can be generated by a single element $\\\\(\\alpha \\\\in L\\\\)$ over $K$. This definition focuses on the ability to express $L$ as $K(\\\\alpha)$, where $\\\\alpha$ is some element of $L$. The definition does not require that all elements of $L$ be algebraic over $K$, only that $L$ can be generated by a single element from $K$. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension involves a field extension $L / K$ where every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This definition is concerned with the nature of the elements of $L$ in relation to $K$, specifically that they must all be algebraic over $K$. \\n\\nThe definition of a Simple Field Extension does not inherently require or imply that every element of $L$ must be algebraic over $K$. It only requires that there exists at least one element $\\\\alpha$ in $L$ such that $L$ can be generated by $\\\\alpha$ over $K$. Therefore, the concept of a Trivial Algebraic Field Extension is not necessary for the definition of a Simple Field Extension to make sense.",
