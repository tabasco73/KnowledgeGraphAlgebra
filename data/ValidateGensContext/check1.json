                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring requires a definition of a Law of Composition, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Ring Definition**: A ring is defined as a set R with two laws of composition: addition '+' and multiplication '.'. These laws of composition must satisfy certain properties such as commutativity for addition, associativity for multiplication, and distributivity of multiplication over addition.\\n\\n2. **Law of Composition Definition**: A law of composition is a map from a set M x M to M, essentially defining how two elements of the set combine to form another element of the set. This is typically represented as a product or sum.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a ring inherently involves laws of composition. The operations of addition and multiplication in a ring are examples of laws of composition as they map pairs of elements from the ring to another element within the ring, adhering to specific algebraic rules.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a ring not only uses but fundamentally requires the concept of a law of composition to define its structure and operations. Without laws of composition, the operations within a ring that satisfy the ring's algebraic properties could not be defined.",
