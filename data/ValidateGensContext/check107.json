                "Explanation": "To understand whether a polynomial is irreducible, one must first understand what a polynomial is. The definition of an irreducible polynomial explicitly references the concept of a polynomial, stating that it is a polynomial $f$ in a ring $R[X]$. This implies that the polynomial is of the form $f=\\nsum_{j=0}^{n} a_{j} X^{j}$, as defined in the concept of a Polynomial. Without understanding this structure, one cannot determine if a polynomial can be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials, because the very notion of factoring requires understanding the components (terms) of the polynomial. Therefore, the concept of a Polynomial is necessary to make sense of what an Irreducible Polynomial is.",
