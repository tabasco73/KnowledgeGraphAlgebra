                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a left coset, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a left coset:\\n\\n1. A left coset of a subgroup $H$ in a group $G$ is described as a subset of $G$. The term 'subset' inherently refers to the concept of a set, as a subset is defined as a set that contains some or all elements of another set.\\n\\n2. The definition of a left coset explicitly states that it is of the form $aH = \\{ah; h \\in H\\}$, where $a \\in G$. This notation $\\{ah; h \\in H\\}$ is set-builder notation, which is used to define a set based on a specific property or rule.\\n\\n3. The elements of the left coset $aH$ are generated by multiplying each element $h$ of the subgroup $H$ by the element $a$ of the group $G$. The result is a collection of elements, which is considered a set according to the definition of a set as a 'collection of distinct objects considered as an entity'.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of a set is fundamental to the definition of a left coset. Without the concept of a set, the notion of a subset or the use of set-builder notation would not make sense, and thus the definition of a left coset would be incomplete.",
