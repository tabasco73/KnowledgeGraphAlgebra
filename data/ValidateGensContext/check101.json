                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Solvable group, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a Solvable group:\\n\\n1. A group $G$ is defined as a set with a binary operation (law of composition) that satisfies certain properties (associativity, identity element, and inverses).\\n2. The definition of a Solvable group involves a sequence of subgroups and normal subgroups, and crucially, the quotient groups $G_i / G_{i+1}$ being abelian.\\n3. An abelian group is a group where the group operation is commutative. This implies that the operation (law of composition) in each quotient group $G_i / G_{i+1}$ must be well-defined and satisfy the group axioms, including commutativity.\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a group inherently requires a law of composition. Since a Solvable group is a specific type of group, and its definition involves operations within groups and quotient groups, the law of composition is fundamental to defining what a group is and, by extension, what a Solvable group is.\\n\\nThus, the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Solvable group because without a law of composition, the structure of a group, and consequently the structure of a Solvable group, cannot be established.",
