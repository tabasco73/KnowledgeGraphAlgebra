                "Explanation": "The concept of a torsion submodule is defined within the context of modules over a ring. A torsion submodule T of an A-module M includes elements of M that satisfy certain conditions related to the ring A. The definition of a torsion submodule does not inherently require the ring A to be a division ring; it only requires A to be a ring (not necessarily with the property that every nonzero element is a unit).\\n\\nOn the other hand, a division ring is a specific type of ring where every nonzero element is invertible. This property of being a division ring does not influence the basic definition or existence of a torsion submodule in a module over a ring. The concept of torsion elements and torsion submodules can be applied to modules over any ring, not just division rings.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a division ring is not necessary for the definition of a torsion submodule to make sense. The concept of a torsion submodule is applicable as long as there is a ring A, regardless of whether A is a division ring or not.",
