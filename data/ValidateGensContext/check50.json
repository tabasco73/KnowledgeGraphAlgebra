This definition is analogous to the quotient space in vector spaces and does not inherently require the underlying ring A to be Noetherian. The concept of a Noetherian ring pertains to properties of ideals within the ring, specifically that every ascending chain of ideals becomes stationary or that every ideal is finitely generated. This property of the ring does not directly influence the basic definition of a residue class module, which can be defined over any ring, whether Noetherian or not. Therefore, the concept of a Noetherian ring is not necessary for the definition of a residue class module to make sense.",
