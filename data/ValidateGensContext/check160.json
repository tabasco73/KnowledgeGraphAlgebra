                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field of Fractions is defined specifically for an integral domain, which is a particular type of ring. The definition of a Field of Fractions involves creating a set of equivalence classes of pairs from the elements of the integral domain, where each pair consists of elements from the integral domain itself. This process does not inherently require the concept of a subring. A subring is defined as a subset of a ring that itself forms a ring under the same operations. While understanding subrings can enhance the understanding of ring theory and the structures within rings, the definition and construction of a Field of Fractions can be fully understood and implemented without directly referencing or requiring the concept of a subring. Therefore, the concept of a subring is not necessary for the definition of a Field of Fractions to make sense.",
