A homomorphism between two $A$-algebras $B$ and $C$ is a ring homomorphism $B \\longrightarrow C$ that is compatible with the defining homomorphisms $A \\longrightarrow B$ and $A \\longrightarrow C$, ensuring the commutativity of the diagram involving these maps."

                "Explanation": "The concept of a Finite Ring Homomorphism involves a ring homomorphism \\n\\between two rings A and B, where B is considered as a finite A-module. This \\nconcept inherently requires understanding the structure of B as an A-module, \\nwhich is a fundamental aspect of the definition of an algebra over a ring. \\n\\nIn the definition of an Algebra over a Ring, B is defined via a ring \\nhomomorphism from A to B, which is exactly the structure needed to consider B \\nas an A-module in the context of a Finite Ring Homomorphism. Thus, the \\nconcept of an Algebra over a Ring provides the necessary framework and \\nterminology (like A-module) to properly define and understand what it means for \\nB to be finite over A in the context of a Finite Ring Homomorphism. \\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an Algebra over a Ring is essential for the \\ndefinition of a Finite Ring Homomorphism to make sense, as it establishes the \\nunderlying relationship and structure between A and B.",
