                "Explanation": "The definition of a ring homomorphism explicitly states that the map \\(\\varphi\\) must satisfy the condition \\(\\varphi(a+b)=\\varphi(a)+\\varphi(b)\\) for all \\(a, b \\in R\\), which is precisely the definition of a group homomorphism with respect to addition. This means that the concept of a group homomorphism is inherently used in defining a ring homomorphism, as the addition operation in rings forms an abelian group. Therefore, understanding and defining a group homomorphism is necessary to fully grasp and define what a ring homomorphism is, particularly in how it preserves the additive structure of the ring.",
