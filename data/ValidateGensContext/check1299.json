                "Explanation": "The concept of a Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields involves understanding the group of automorphisms of the splitting field that fix the base field and permute the roots of the polynomial. This concept primarily revolves around the notions of fields, automorphisms, and permutations of roots.\\n\\nThe Cartesian Product, on the other hand, is a set-theoretic concept that defines the set of all ordered pairs from a given set. It is used in various areas of mathematics, including the definition of relations and functions, but it is not directly involved in the definition or understanding of a Galois Group.\\n\\nTherefore, while both concepts are mathematical, the Cartesian Product is not a prerequisite for defining or understanding the Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields. The Galois Group focuses on symmetries and field automorphisms, which do not inherently require the concept of Cartesian Products.",
