The factor ring, or residue class ring, $R / \\mathfrak{a}$, is defined initially as an abelian group by viewing $\\mathfrak{a}$ as a (normal) subgroup of the additive group of $R$. The elements of $R / \\mathfrak{a}$ are all residue classes of type $x+\\mathfrak{a}$ for $x \\in R$, where addition is given by $(x+\\mathfrak{a})+(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x+y)+\\mathfrak{a}$ and multiplication by $(x+\\mathfrak{a}) \\cdot(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x \\cdot y)+\\mathfrak{a}$. The ring properties of $R$ carry over to $R / \\mathfrak{a}$."

                "Explanation": "The concept of a Factor Group and a Factor Ring, while similar in their structural formation, are defined independently within their respective algebraic structures. The Factor Group is defined within the context of group theory, specifically dealing with groups and normal subgroups. The operation and the structure are based solely on the properties of groups. On the other hand, the Factor Ring is defined within the context of ring theory, dealing with rings and ideals. The definition of a Factor Ring extends beyond the abelian group structure (additive group) to include a multiplication operation that respects the ring structure.\\n\\nThe definition of a Factor Group does not rely on or require the concept of a Factor Ring. It is solely dependent on the properties of groups and normal subgroups. The Factor Ring involves additional algebraic structure (i.e., ring structure), which includes both addition and multiplication, but this structure is not necessary for understanding or defining a Factor Group. Therefore, the concept of a Factor Ring is not needed for the definition of a Factor Group to make sense.",
