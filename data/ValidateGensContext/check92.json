An algebraic field extension \\\\(K \\subset L\\\\) is called normal if it satisfies the equivalent conditions of Theorem 4: (i) Every \\\\(K\\\\)-homomorphism \\\\(L \\longrightarrow \\bar{L}\\\\) into an algebraic closure \\\\(\\bar{L}\\\\) of \\\\(L\\\\) restricts to an automorphism of \\\\(L\\\\). (ii) \\\\(L\\\\) is a splitting field of a family of polynomials in \\\\(K[X]\\\\).

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a normal field extension is necessary for the definition of a Galois group of a field extension to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of the Galois group of a field extension is the group of all field automorphisms of L that fix every element of K. This definition inherently requires understanding what field automorphisms are and how they operate within the context of a field extension L/K.\\n\\n2. The definition of a normal field extension involves the extension being the splitting field of a family of polynomials from the base field, and it ensures that every K-homomorphism from L to an algebraic closure of L restricts to an automorphism of L. This property is crucial for the field extension to have a well-defined set of automorphisms that fix K, which are exactly the elements of the Galois group.\\n\\n3. If an extension is not normal, then there might exist K-homomorphisms from L to its algebraic closure that do not restrict to automorphisms of L. This would mean that the set of automorphisms that fix K might not capture all the symmetries of L over K, or worse, might not form a group at all.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the normality of the field extension ensures that the set of automorphisms that fix K (i.e., the Galois group) is well-defined and behaves consistently as a group. Without the extension being normal, the concept of the Galois group might not be meaningful or might not exhibit the properties expected of a group.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a normal field extension is necessary for the definition of a Galois group of a field extension to make sense.",
