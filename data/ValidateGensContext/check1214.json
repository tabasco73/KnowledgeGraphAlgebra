                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of an 'Integral Element over a Ring' to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of an 'Integral Element over a Ring' involves an element $b \\in B$, where $B$ is a ring. The notation $b \\in B$ directly implies that $b$ is an element of the set $B$. This usage is fundamental to the definition because it specifies that $b$ is part of the ring $B$.\\n\\n2. The definition further involves operations and properties that assume $b$ is an element of a set (in this case, the ring $B$), such as forming polynomials $f(b)=0$ in $A[X]$ and considering submodules like $A[b] \\subset B$.\\n\\n3. The concept of an 'Element of a Set' provides the foundational understanding that $b$ is an object belonging to the set $B$. Without this basic concept, the operations and properties described in the definition of an 'Integral Element over a Ring' would not have a clear meaning, as they rely on the notion that $b$ is part of a set (or ring).\\n\\n4. Therefore, understanding that $b$ is an element of the set $B' is crucial for making sense of the definition of an 'Integral Element over a Ring'. Without the concept of an 'Element of a Set', the relationship and operations involving $b$ in the context of rings and modules would lack a necessary foundational basis.",
