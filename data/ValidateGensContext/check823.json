                "Explanation": "To understand the concept of an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field, it is essential to first understand what a field is. The definition of an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field explicitly mentions that it is a field itself, which contains the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and all its algebraic extensions. Without understanding what a field is, one cannot comprehend the properties or the structure of the algebraic closure. A field, as defined, is a commutative division ring, which implies certain algebraic operations and properties such as addition, multiplication, and the existence of multiplicative inverses for non-zero elements. These properties are crucial in discussing the algebraic closure of a finite field, as they influence how the extensions and the overall structure of the algebraic closure are formed and interact. Therefore, the concept of a field is fundamental and necessary for the definition and understanding of an algebraic closure of a finite field.",
