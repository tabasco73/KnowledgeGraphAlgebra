                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an Extension Field is necessary for defining an Algebraic Field Extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Algebraic Field Extension**: This definition states that an extension field $L$ over $K$ is algebraic if every element in $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This implies that $L$ is a field that extends $K$, and each element of $L$ can be expressed as a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in $K$.\\n\\n2. **Extension Field**: The provided definition specifically describes a finite field extension $\\[\\mathbb{F}_q / \\mathbb{F}_p\\]$ where $q = p^n$. This is a specific case of an extension field, focusing on finite fields derived from a prime field $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of an Extension Field in general (not just the specific case of $\\[\\mathbb{F}_q / \\mathbb{F}_p\\]$) is fundamental to the concept of an Algebraic Field Extension. The definition of an Algebraic Field Extension inherently relies on the existence of an extension field $L$ over a base field $K$. Without the concept of an extension field, the notion of elements being algebraic over another field would not make sense, as there would be no 'larger' field in which these elements reside that extends the 'smaller' field $K$.\\n\\nThus, the general concept of an Extension Field (a field that extends another field) is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic Field Extension to make sense, even though the specific example given ($\\[\\mathbb{F}_q / \\mathbb{F}_p\\]$) is just one type of extension field.",
