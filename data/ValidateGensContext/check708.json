                "Explanation": "The definition of a p-group focuses solely on the group itself and its order being a power of a prime number p. It does not involve any external set or the interaction of the group with any set, which is the essence of a group action. A group action involves a group operating on a set, which is not required to define the concept of a p-group. Therefore, the concept of a group action is not necessary for the definition of a p-group to make sense.",
