                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an Extension Field is necessary for the definition of a Galois extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Galois Extension**: Defined as an extension $K_r / K$ that is both normal and separable. This definition inherently involves the concept of an extension of fields, as it refers to one field being an extension of another.\\n\\n2. **Extension Field**: Described specifically as an extension field $\\mathbb{F}_q / \\mathbb{F}_p$ with $q = p^n$ elements. This definition provides a specific example of a field extension, particularly in the context of finite fields.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Galois extension inherently relies on the notion of one field being an extension of another, which is precisely what an Extension Field describes. Although the provided definition of an Extension Field focuses on a specific case (finite fields), the general concept of a field extension (one field being an extension of another) is fundamental to understanding what a Galois extension is. Therefore, the concept of an Extension Field is necessary to properly define and understand a Galois extension.",
