            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The concept of an Ideal corresponding to a subset involves the set of all polynomials that vanish on a given subset of a space, typically in the context of algebraic geometry or commutative algebra. This definition inherently relies on the properties of polynomial rings and the concept of vanishing of polynomials, which are algebraic structures but not necessarily groups in the sense defined.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Group is defined as a set with a specific type of binary operation that satisfies certain properties like associativity, identity, and inverses. The definition of a group focuses on elements and operations within the set that form a specific algebraic structure.\\n\\nThe definition of an Ideal does not require the elements of the polynomial ring to have inverses with respect to addition or multiplication, which is a key requirement in the definition of a group. The polynomial ring itself, while being a ring (and thus an additive group), does not need to satisfy the conditions of having inverses for multiplication for all its elements, which is a requirement for groups in general.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Group is not necessary to define an Ideal corresponding to a subset. The essential requirements for defining an Ideal involve understanding sets, functions (polynomials), and their properties like vanishing, none of which inherently require the concept of a group as defined.",
