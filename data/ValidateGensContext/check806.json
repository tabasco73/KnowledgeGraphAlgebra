                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a subfield needs to be defined for the definition of a simple field extension to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies between the two concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Simple Field Extension**: This definition involves a field extension $K \\subset L$, where $L$ is expressed as $K(\\alpha)$ for some element $\\alpha \\in L$. The notation $K(\\alpha)$ implies the smallest field containing both $K$ and $\\alpha$. This definition inherently assumes the existence of fields and field extensions but does not explicitly require the concept of a subfield.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Subfield**: This definition describes a subring $T$ of a field $K$ that is itself a field. It focuses on the properties that make a subset of a field also a field, emphasizing the internal structure and properties of $T$.\\n\\n3. **Dependency Analysis**: The concept of a simple field extension primarily relies on the understanding of fields and field extensions. It does not directly depend on the concept of a subfield, as it does not require analyzing or identifying subfields within $K$ or $L$. The simple field extension is concerned with expressing $L$ in terms of an element from $L$ and its interactions with $K$, rather than identifying or verifying subfield structures within $K$ or $L$.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: The definition of a simple field extension does not require the definition of a subfield to be understood or applied. It is more directly related to the concepts of fields and elements within those fields, rather than the structure of subfields.",
