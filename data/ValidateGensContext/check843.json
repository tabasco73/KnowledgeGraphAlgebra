                "Explanation": "The definition of a Symmetric Group involves the group of all bijective self-maps of a set, specifically the set of permutations of {1, ..., n}. This definition focuses on the properties and structure of permutations and does not inherently require the concept of a Center. The Center of a group, defined as the set of all elements that commute with every other element in the group, is a concept used to analyze specific properties within group theory, such as the internal structure and behavior of elements in a group. However, the existence and definition of a Symmetric Group do not depend on the concept of a Center. The Symmetric Group can be fully defined and understood without reference to its Center. Thus, the concept of a Center is not necessary for the definition of a Symmetric Group to make sense.",
