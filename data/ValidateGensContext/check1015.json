                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring Extension is necessary for the definition of a Field Extension to make sense, we need to analyze the relationship between the concepts of rings and fields. A field is a special type of ring with certain additional properties, specifically that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Therefore, every field is also a ring, but not every ring is a field.\\n\\nThe definition of a Field Extension involves a pair of fields, $K \\subset L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This definition inherently implies that $L$ and $K$ are also rings, and $K$ is a subring of $L$. However, the definition of a Field Extension focuses specifically on the field properties, not just the ring properties.\\n\\nThe concept of a Ring Extension is broader and applies to any pair of rings where one is a subring of the other. While understanding Ring Extensions might provide additional context or a broader understanding of algebraic structures, it is not strictly necessary for understanding or defining a Field Extension. The definition of a Field Extension stands on its own, focusing on the properties and relationships specific to fields.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Ring Extension is not needed for the definition of a Field Extension to make sense. The essential aspect of a Field Extension is the field properties, not the general ring properties.",
