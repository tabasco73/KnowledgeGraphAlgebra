                "Explanation": "The concept of a Maximal Ideal is defined independently of the concept of a Principal Ideal Domain. The definition of a Maximal Ideal only requires the structure of a ring and does not necessitate that every ideal in the ring be principal, which is the defining characteristic of a Principal Ideal Domain. A Maximal Ideal is defined as a proper ideal in a ring that is not contained in any larger proper ideal. This definition can be applied to any ring, whether or not it is a Principal Ideal Domain. Therefore, the concept of a Principal Ideal Domain is not necessary for the definition of a Maximal Ideal to make sense.",
