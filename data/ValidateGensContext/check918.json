            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic Element, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of an Algebraic Element involves a field extension $K \\subset L$, where $K$ and $L$ are fields. Fields are a special kind of ring, specifically a commutative ring with a multiplicative inverse for every non-zero element.\\n\\n2. The definition of an Algebraic Element also involves an algebraic equation with coefficients in $K$. This equation uses operations like addition and multiplication, which are defined under the structure of a ring.\\n\\n3. Since fields are a subset of rings (every field is a ring but not every ring is a field), the operations and properties used in defining an algebraic element (like addition and multiplication) are inherently ring operations.\\n\\n4. Therefore, understanding and defining a field (as used in the definition of an Algebraic Element) inherently requires the concept of a ring, because a field is a particular type of ring.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a Ring is necessary to properly define and understand a Field, which in turn is essential for defining an Algebraic Element as per the given definitions.",
