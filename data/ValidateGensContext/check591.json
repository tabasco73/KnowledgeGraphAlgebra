                "Explanation": "The definition of a Symmetric Group involves the group of all bijective self-maps of a set with a specific number of elements, denoted as $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$. This definition inherently implies a finite set of size $n$, and thus the group formed, $\\mathfrak{S}_{n}$, is composed of all permutations of these $n$ elements. The order of this group, which is the number of elements (or permutations) in the group, is $n!$ (n factorial), because each element can be mapped to $n$ positions, the second to $n-1$ remaining positions, and so forth.\\n\\nThe concept of the order of a group, which counts the number of elements in the group, is not necessary to define what a symmetric group is. The symmetric group can be fully described and understood as the group of all permutations of a finite set without explicitly mentioning its order. The order is a property that can be derived from understanding the structure of the group (i.e., knowing it consists of all permutations of $n$ elements), but it is not required to initially define or understand what a symmetric group is.",
