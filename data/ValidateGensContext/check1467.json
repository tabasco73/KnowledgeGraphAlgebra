                "Explanation": "To understand the concept of the 'Image of a Map,' it is essential to first comprehend what a 'Map' or 'Function' is. The definition of 'Image of a Map' explicitly refers to a function 'f: A to B,' indicating a relationship where elements of set A are associated with elements of set B. Without understanding this relationship, the concept of an image, which involves elements of B that are associated with at least one element in A via the function, cannot be fully grasped. Therefore, the definition of a Map/Function is fundamental to making sense of what an Image of a Map is, as it lays the groundwork for understanding how elements are related and associated between two sets.",
