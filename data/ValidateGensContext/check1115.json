The definition of the Kernel of a Ring Homomorphism states that it is a set of elements from a ring $R$ that map to zero under the homomorphism $\\\\[\\varphi: R \\longrightarrow R'\\\\]$. Importantly, it specifies that this set is an ideal in $R$.\\n\\n2. The definition of an Ideal specifies what it means for a subset of a ring to be an ideal: it must be an additive subgroup and must be closed under multiplication by any element from the ring.\\n\\nGiven that the definition of the Kernel explicitly mentions that it is an ideal, understanding what an ideal is becomes crucial. Without knowing what an ideal is, one cannot fully comprehend why the kernel, as defined, has the properties it does (such as being closed under addition and ring multiplication). Thus, the concept of an Ideal is necessary to fully understand and validate the definition of the Kernel of a Ring Homomorphism.",
