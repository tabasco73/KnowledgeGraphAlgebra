                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Ring Extension is necessary for the definition of a System of Generators of an Ideal to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies of the latter on the former.\\n\\n1. The definition of a System of Generators of an Ideal involves an ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) of a ring \\\\(R\\\\) and a family of elements \\\\(\\left(a_{i}\\right)_{i \\in I}\\\\) within that ideal. The system of generators is defined such that the ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) is the sum of the ideals generated by each \\\\(a_i\\\\) in \\\\(R\\\\).\\n\\n2. This definition is self-contained with respect to the ring \\\\(R\\\\) and does not require any additional structure or concept outside of the elements of \\\\(R\\\\) and its ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\).\\n\\n3. The concept of a Ring Extension involves a pair (S, R) where \\\\(S\\\\) is a subring of \\\\(R\\\\). This concept pertains to the relationship between two rings, one being a subring of the other.\\n\\n4. The definition of a System of Generators of an Ideal does not involve any relationship between two different rings or the concept of subrings. It solely focuses on the elements and the structure within a single ring \\\\(R\\\\).\\n\\n5. Therefore, the concept of a Ring Extension, which deals with the properties and relationships between two rings, is not necessary for understanding or defining a System of Generators of an Ideal, which deals exclusively with the internal structure of a single ring and its ideals.",
