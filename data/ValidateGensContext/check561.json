                "Explanation": "The concept of an algebraic subset involves the set of common zeros of a collection of polynomials from a polynomial ring over a field. This definition primarily relies on the properties of fields and polynomial rings, specifically focusing on the solutions to polynomial equations in a given field.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a monoid is a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element. The definition of a monoid pertains to abstract algebra and is used to describe structures with associative operations, but it does not directly relate to the concept of polynomial rings or their zeros.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of an algebraic subset do not require the concept of a monoid. The algebraic subset is concerned with solutions to polynomial equations, which is independent of the monoid structure.",
