                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Set needs to be defined for the definition of an Element of a Set to make sense, we can analyze the dependency of the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of an Element of a Set states that it is 'an object belonging to a set.' This definition inherently relies on the concept of a 'set' as it specifies that the element must belong to something identified as a set.\\n\\n2. Without understanding what a set is, the definition of an element of a set becomes ambiguous and incomplete. The term 'set' in the definition of an element of a set refers directly to the concept of a Set, which is defined as 'a collection of distinct objects considered as an entity.'\\n\\n3. Therefore, the concept of a Set provides the necessary context and framework within which the concept of an Element of a Set can be understood. Without the definition of a Set, one cannot fully comprehend what it means for something to be an element of a set, as the nature of the 'set' itself would be undefined.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a Set is essential for the definition of an Element of a Set to be meaningful and complete. The definition of an Element of a Set depends on the prior understanding of what a Set is.",
