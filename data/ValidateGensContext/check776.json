                "Explanation": "The definition of a Dihedral Group, $D_n$, involves the group of symmetries of a regular $n$-gon, which includes both rotations and reflections. The group is generated by specific permutations $\\tau$ and $\\tau$. The concept of the order of a group pertains to the number of elements in the group. Understanding the Dihedral Group does not inherently require knowing its order, as the group's definition and generation can be understood independently of how many elements it contains. The order of the group is a property that can be derived from its definition but is not necessary to define what a Dihedral Group is or how it operates. Therefore, the concept of the order of a group is not necessary for the definition of a Dihedral Group to make sense.",
