It is the unique smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $X$ and consists of all elements of the form $x_{1}^{\\varepsilon_{1}} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_{n}^{\\varepsilon_{n}}$ where $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n} \\in X$ and $\\varepsilon_{1}, \\ldots, $\\varepsilon_{n} \\in \\{1,-1\\}$, with $n$ varying over $\\mathbb{N}$."

            "Let $G$ be a monoid. A subset $H \\subset G$ is called a submonoid if $H$ satisfies the following conditions: (i) $e \\in H$, (ii) $a, b \\in H \\Longrightarrow a b \\in H$. If $G$ is a group, $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if in addition, (iii) $a \\in H \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\in H$. In particular, a subgroup of a group $G$ is a submonoid that is closed under the process of taking inverses. In defining a subgroup $H \\subset G$, condition (i) can be weakened by simply requiring $H \\neq \\emptyset$, since this implies $e \\in H$ using (ii) and (iii). Of course, similar reasoning is not possible for monoids. Every group $G$ admits $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ as trivial subgroups. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the set $m \\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integral multiples of $m$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}$. We will see in 1.3/4 that all subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of this type. More generally, every element $a$ of a group $G$ gives rise to a so-called cyclic subgroup of $G$. It consists of all powers $a^{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where we put $a^{n}=\\left(a^{-1}\\right)^{-n}$ for $n<0; see also Section 1.3."

                "Explanation": "The concept of a subgroup generated by a set is a specific method to construct subgroups in a group, particularly useful when dealing with an arbitrary subset of a group and determining the smallest subgroup containing that subset. However, the definition of a subgroup itself, as provided, does not inherently require the concept of a subgroup generated by a set. The definition of a subgroup is based on certain properties that any subset must satisfy to be considered a subgroup (closure under the group operation, containing the identity element, and closure under taking inverses for groups). These criteria can be verified independently of the concept of generating a subgroup by a set. Thus, while the concept of a subgroup generated by a set is a useful tool in group theory for constructing and understanding subgroups, it is not a prerequisite for the definition or understanding of what constitutes a subgroup in general. Therefore, the concept of a subgroup generated by a set is not necessary for the definition of a subgroup to make sense.",
