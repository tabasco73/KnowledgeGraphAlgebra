                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a purely inseparable extension, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a purely inseparable extension. The definition involves the concept of a field extension, which is itself a type of set, specifically a set of elements that forms a field under certain operations. Additionally, the definition mentions the minimal polynomial of any element in the extension, which implies the existence of a set of polynomials and their roots. Since the concept of a field extension inherently relies on the notion of sets (as it involves collections of elements that adhere to specific algebraic rules), and since polynomials and their roots also form sets, the concept of a set is fundamental to understanding and defining a purely inseparable extension. Without the concept of a set, the notion of collecting elements into a field or considering the roots of a polynomial would not be properly defined, making it impossible to articulate what a purely inseparable extension is.",
