            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Stabilizer inherently involves the concept of a group. Specifically, the stabilizer is defined within the context of a group action, where a group $G$ acts on a set $X$. The stabilizer, $G_x$, is a subset of $G$ consisting of all elements in $G$ that leave a particular element $x \\n X$ unchanged under the group action. This definition presupposes the existence of a group $G$, as it refers to elements $g \\n G$ and their action on $x$. Without the concept of a group, the notion of a group action, and hence the definition of a stabilizer, would not make sense. Therefore, the concept of a group is essential for the definition of a stabilizer to be meaningful.",
