More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

A subgroup $H$ itself cannot exist without the concept of a group because a subgroup is defined based on the properties of a group. Therefore, the concept of a group is fundamental and necessary for defining what a right coset is. Without the concept of a group, the terms used in the definition of a right coset, such as 'subgroup' and the operation used to form $Ha = \\{ha; h \\in H\\}$, would not have a meaningful context or definition.",
