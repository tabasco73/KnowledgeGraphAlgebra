(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of an Integral Domain, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of an Integral Domain starts by referring to a 'commutative ring R'. This implies that the concept of a ring is already assumed as known and understood.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Ring provides the necessary characteristics and structure (such as the existence of addition and multiplication operations, associativity, distributivity, and the existence of a unit element) that are foundational to understanding what a 'commutative ring' is, as mentioned in the definition of an Integral Domain.\\n\\n3. Without understanding what a Ring is, one cannot fully grasp the concept of a 'commutative ring', since a commutative ring is a specific type of ring where the multiplication operation is commutative.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a Ring must be defined and understood first to make sense of what an Integral Domain is, as the latter is a subset or a special case of the former.",
