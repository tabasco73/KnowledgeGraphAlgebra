                "Explanation": "The definition of an Integral Ring Homomorphism explicitly references the concept of a Ring Homomorphism. It states that a ring homomorphism \\(\\varphi: A \\longrightarrow B\\) is integral if every element \\(b \\in B\\) is integral over \\(A\\). This definition presupposes the existence of a ring homomorphism \\(\\varphi\\) between two rings \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Without understanding what a ring homomorphism is, one cannot comprehend what it means for such a map to be integral. The properties and structure of a ring homomorphism, such as the preservation of addition and multiplication, are fundamental to understanding how elements of \\(B\\) can be integral over \\(A\\). Therefore, the concept of a Ring Homomorphism is necessary for the definition of an Integral Ring Homomorphism to make sense.",
