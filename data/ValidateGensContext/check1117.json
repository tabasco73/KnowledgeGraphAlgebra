                "Explanation": "The definition of a Noetherian ring involves the concept of ideals directly. It states that a ring is Noetherian if every ascending chain of ideals becomes stationary after finitely many steps, or if every ideal is finitely generated. This definition inherently requires understanding what an ideal is, as it refers to properties and behaviors of ideals within the ring. Without the concept of an ideal, the definition of a Noetherian ring would not make sense because it would be unclear what the terms referring to 'ideals' mean. Therefore, the concept of an ideal is essential and must be defined for the definition of a Noetherian ring to be meaningful and complete.",
