            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Ring Isomorphism to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Ring Isomorphism involves a function \\\\(\\textbackslash{}varphi: R \\\\longrightarrow R'\\\\) that is a ring homomorphism and is bijective. This definition inherently requires the existence of two objects, R and R', which are implied to be rings because \\\\(\\textbackslash{}varphi\\\\) is specified as a ring homomorphism.\\n\\n2. A ring homomorphism is a function between two rings that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication). Therefore, the concept of a ring homomorphism cannot exist without the prior definition of what a ring is, as it relies on the properties and operations defined within the structure of a ring.\\n\\n3. The definition of a Ring provides the necessary structure and operations (addition and multiplication) that are preserved by a ring homomorphism. Without understanding what a ring is, one cannot comprehend what it means for a function to preserve the operations of a ring, which is essential for defining a ring homomorphism and, subsequently, a ring isomorphism.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Ring must be defined and understood before one can meaningfully define or understand what a Ring Isomorphism is. Thus, the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Ring Isomorphism to make sense.",
