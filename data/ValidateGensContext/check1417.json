                "Explanation": "The concept of the characteristic of a field is crucial when discussing purely inseparable extensions, particularly in fields of positive characteristic. In fields of characteristic zero, every algebraic extension is separable, meaning that purely inseparable extensions do not occur. However, in fields of positive characteristic, say $p$, purely inseparable extensions are characterized by the fact that the minimal polynomials of elements in the extension field have roots that are repeated $p^n$ times for some $n$. This is directly related to the characteristic of the field, as the minimal polynomial's form and the behavior of its roots are influenced by the field's characteristic. Therefore, understanding whether a field extension is purely inseparable requires knowledge of the field's characteristic, as it determines the nature of the minimal polynomials and the multiplicity of their roots.",
