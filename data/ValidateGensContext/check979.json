            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of a Subfield, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Subfield states that it is a subring of a field that is itself a field. This implies that the subfield must satisfy all the properties of a field.\\n\\n2. A field, by definition, is a set equipped with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfies certain properties including the existence of additive and multiplicative identities, the existence of additive inverses (making it an abelian group under addition), and the existence of multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements (making the non-zero elements an abelian group under multiplication).\\n\\n3. The definition of a Group is a set with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element, and every element has an inverse. This definition is fundamental in understanding the structure of a field because a field can be seen as comprising two groups: an abelian group under addition and a commutative group under multiplication (excluding the zero element).\\n\\n4. Therefore, understanding the concept of a Group is essential to fully grasp the concept of a Field, and consequently, a Subfield. The properties of a field (and thus a subfield) directly rely on the properties of groups, specifically the existence of inverses and identity elements, which are defined in the concept of a Group.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Group is necessary to define a Subfield, as the properties of fields (and subfields) are built upon the foundational properties of groups.",
