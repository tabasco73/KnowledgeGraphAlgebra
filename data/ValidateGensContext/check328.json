                "Explanation": "The definition of a ring homomorphism involves two main conditions: preserving the addition and multiplication operations of the rings involved. Specifically, a function \\n\\between two rings is a ring homomorphism if it satisfies \\n\\for all elements in the first ring, the image under the homomorphism of the sum or product of any two elements equals the sum or product of their images, respectively. This definition does not require that the multiplication operation in either ring be commutative; it only requires that the homomorphism respect the existing operations, whether they are commutative or not.\\n\\nThe commutative law, on the other hand, specifically states that a binary operation on a set is commutative if the order of the operands does not affect the result of the operation. This property is not a prerequisite for the definition of a ring homomorphism. Rings can be either commutative or non-commutative, and ring homomorphisms are defined for both types. Therefore, the concept of the commutative law is not necessary for the definition of a ring homomorphism to make sense.",
