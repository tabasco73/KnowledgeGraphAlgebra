                "Explanation": "The concept of the order of an element in a group is focused on the properties of the element within the group itself, specifically how many times the element must be combined with itself to return the identity element of the group. This concept is purely algebraic and pertains to the internal structure of the group.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of an orbit involves a group acting on a set, which is a different context. It describes how the elements of the group can transform or permute elements of another set. This concept is more about the interaction between a group and some external set.\\n\\nGiven these definitions, the concept of an orbit is not necessary to define or understand the order of an element in a group. The order of an element can be fully understood and defined without reference to any action on an external set, which is what the concept of an orbit involves.",
