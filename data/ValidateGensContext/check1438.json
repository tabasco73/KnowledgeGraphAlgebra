                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Finite Field is necessary for the definition of an Extension Field to make sense, we need to analyze the relationship between these two concepts based on their definitions.\\n\\n1. The definition of an Extension Field $\\[\\mathbb{F}_q / \\mathbb{F}_p\\]$ mentions that it is a field with $q=p^n$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number and $n$ is a positive integer. This definition inherently implies a structure that is a field with a finite number of elements, specifically $q$ elements.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Finite Field $\\[\\mathbb{F}_{q}\\]$ also describes a field with $q$ elements, where $q=p^n$ for some prime $p$ and integer $n>0$. This matches the structure described in the Extension Field definition.\\n\\n3. The Extension Field is described as a field that is an extension of $\\[\\mathbb{F}_p\\]$, meaning it builds upon the concept of a field with fewer elements ($p$ elements) to a field with more elements ($q$ elements). The concept of increasing the number of elements while maintaining field properties (no zero divisors, associative, commutative, etc.) is central to both definitions.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of a Finite Field, the idea of having a field with a finite number of elements ($q=p^n$) would not be clearly defined or understood. The Finite Field concept provides the necessary foundation for understanding how fields can exist with a specific, finite number of elements, which is crucial for defining an Extension Field.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Finite Field is necessary for the definition of an Extension Field to make sense, as it establishes the fundamental properties and structure of fields with a finite number of elements, which is directly used in the definition of an Extension Field.",
