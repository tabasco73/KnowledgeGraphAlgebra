                "Explanation": "The concept of a finitely generated module involves a module over a ring having a finite set of generators. This definition requires the understanding of modules and rings, but does not inherently require the concept of an algebra over a ring. An algebra over a ring involves a more specific structure where there is a ring homomorphism from a ring A to another ring B, making B an A-algebra. This concept is more specialized and pertains to the relationship between two rings rather than the internal structure of a module over a single ring. Therefore, understanding or defining a finitely generated module does not depend on the concept of an algebra over a ring, as the latter deals with additional structures and relationships not necessary for the former.",
