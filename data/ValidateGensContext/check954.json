            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The concept of a Free system of generators (basis) is defined within the context of an A-module M. An A-module is a generalization of the concept of a vector space, where the scalars belong to a ring A instead of a field. The definition of a free system of generators involves linear independence and generating properties within the context of modules over a ring.\\n\\nThe concept of a Group, as defined, involves a set with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element, and every element has an inverse. This definition is focused on the properties of elements under a specific operation and their inverses.\\n\\nThe definition of a free system of generators does not inherently require the concept of a group. It primarily relies on the concepts of rings and modules. While groups and rings are both algebraic structures, the specific properties and operations defined for groups (such as the existence of inverses for all elements) are not necessary to define or understand a free system of generators in the context of modules. Therefore, the concept of a group is not needed to make sense of a free system of generators (basis) in an A-module.",
