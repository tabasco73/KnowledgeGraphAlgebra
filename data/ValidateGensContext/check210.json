                "Explanation": "The concept of the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension involves the group of automorphisms of a field extension that fix the base field. This group is defined as a set of automorphisms with the operation of composition. For this group to be well-defined and function properly within the context of group theory, the operation (composition of functions in this case) must satisfy certain properties, including associativity.\\n\\nThe Associative Law, as defined, states that a composition operation on a set is associative if it satisfies the condition \\n$(ab)c = a(bc)$ for all elements $a, b, c$ in the set. In the context of the Galois Group, the operation of composition of automorphisms must be associative to ensure that the group axioms are satisfied. Therefore, the concept of the Associative Law is inherently required to ensure that the composition of automorphisms forms a group under composition.\\n\\nThus, the Associative Law needs to be defined and understood to validate the structure of the Galois Group as a group, making the concept essential for the definition of the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension to make sense.",
