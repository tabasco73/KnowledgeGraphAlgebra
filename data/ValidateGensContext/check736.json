(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts:\\n\\n1. A finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a special type of ring. It not only satisfies all the properties of a ring (commutative group under addition, monoid under multiplication, and distributive laws) but also has additional properties such as every non-zero element having a multiplicative inverse.\\n\\n2. The definition of the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field, $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$, specifically involves the non-zero elements of the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. These elements form a group under the operation of multiplication.\\n\\n3. The concept of a ring provides the necessary algebraic structure (addition and multiplication operations along with their properties) that underpins the existence and properties of a finite field. Without the ring structure, the operations within a finite field would not be well-defined, and consequently, the multiplicative group structure would also not be well-defined.\\n\\n4. Therefore, understanding and defining a finite field inherently involves understanding it as a ring. The definition and properties of a ring are crucial in establishing the properties of a finite field, which in turn are essential for defining its multiplicative group.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a ring is necessary for the definition of the Multiplicative Group of a Finite Field because the ring structure provides the foundational operations and properties on which the finite field, and thus its multiplicative group, are built.",
