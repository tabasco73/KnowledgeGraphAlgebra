(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Finite Field, we need to analyze the structural requirements and properties of each.\\n\\n1. **Definition of a Ring**: A ring is defined as a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, which satisfy certain properties such as associativity, the existence of a unit element (for rings with unity), and the distributive laws.\\n\\n2. **Definition of a Finite Field**: A finite field is a special kind of ring. It not only satisfies all the properties of a ring (associativity, existence of a unit element, and distributive laws) but also has additional properties such as every non-zero element having a multiplicative inverse. This makes a finite field a commutative division ring.\\n\\n3. **Necessity of Ring Concept**: The definition of a finite field inherently includes the properties of a ring because it requires the existence of two operations (addition and multiplication) that are associative and distributive. Moreover, the concept of a unit element and the absence of zero divisors (which distinguishes fields from general rings) are based on the foundational properties defined in the concept of a ring.\\n\\nThus, the concept of a ring is essential and foundational for the definition of a finite field. Without understanding what a ring is, one cannot fully grasp the structure and properties of a finite field.",
