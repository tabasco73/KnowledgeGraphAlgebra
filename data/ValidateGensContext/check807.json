                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a subfield needs to be defined for the definition of a splitting field to make sense, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts.\\n\\n1. The definition of a splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$ requires that the polynomial factorizes into linear factors in a field $\\mathbb{F}$. This implies that $\\mathbb{F}$ contains all zeros of $X^q-X$.\\n\\n2. The prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is the smallest subfield containing the prime number $p$. It is inherently a subfield of any field that contains it, including the splitting field $\\mathbb{F}$.\\n\\n3. Understanding that $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{F}$ is crucial because it establishes that $\\mathbb{F}$ extends $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and includes additional elements (the roots of $X^q-X$) necessary for the polynomial to split completely.\\n\\n4. The concept of a subfield is essential to define the relationship between $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\\mathbb{F}$. Without the concept of a subfield, we would lack the formal framework to discuss how $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is embedded within $\\mathbb{F}$, and how $\\mathbb{F}$ extends $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\\n\\n5. Therefore, the concept of a subfield is necessary to properly define and understand the structure and properties of the splitting field in relation to its prime subfield.",
