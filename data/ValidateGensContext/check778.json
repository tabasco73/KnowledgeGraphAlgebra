                "Explanation": "To determine the order of an element $a$ in a group $G$, according to the definition provided, one must find the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $a^m = 1$. This calculation inherently involves the concept of taking powers of the element $a$. Specifically, the order of an element is directly related to the powers of that element, as it is defined as the smallest exponent $m$ for which the power $a^m$ equals the identity element of the group.\\n\\nWithout the concept of powers of an element, it would be impossible to compute $a^m$ and thus determine if $a^m = 1$ for any integer $m$. Therefore, the concept of powers of an element is essential for the definition of the order of an element to be meaningful and applicable in any group or algebraic structure where the order is considered.",
