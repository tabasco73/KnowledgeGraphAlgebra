                "Explanation": "To determine the rank of an A-module M, the definition requires identifying the largest number n for which there exists a linearly independent system of elements x_1, ..., x_n in M. This process involves examining subsets of elements within M and assessing their linear independence, but it does not inherently require the concept of a submodule. A submodule involves a subset that is not only closed under addition and scalar multiplication (like a linearly independent set), but also satisfies additional structural conditions to be a module itself. The definition of rank focuses solely on the properties of linear independence and does not require the subset to be a submodule. Therefore, the concept of a submodule is not necessary for defining or understanding the rank of an A-module.",
