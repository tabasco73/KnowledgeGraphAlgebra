                "Explanation": "The concept of a submodule is defined in the context of modules over a ring, which is a generalization of vector spaces over a field. A submodule is a subset of a module that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication by elements of the ring. This definition does not inherently require the concept of a polynomial. Polynomials are expressions formed from variables and coefficients, and while polynomial rings can be considered as modules, the general concept of a submodule does not depend on the specific nature of polynomials. Therefore, understanding or defining a submodule does not necessitate the concept of a polynomial.",
