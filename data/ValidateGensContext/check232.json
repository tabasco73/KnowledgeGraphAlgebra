The elements of $R / \\mathfrak{a}$ are all residue classes of type $x+\\mathfrak{a}$ for $x \\in R$, where addition is given by $(x+\\mathfrak{a})+(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x+y)+\\mathfrak{a}$ and multiplication by $(x+\\mathfrak{a}) \\cdot(y+\\mathfrak{a})=(x \\cdot y)+\\mathfrak{a}$.

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a System of Generators of an Ideal is necessary for the definition of a Factor Ring, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Factor Ring Definition**: The definition of a factor ring involves an ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) in a ring \\\\(R\\\\), and constructs the factor ring \\\\(R / \\mathfrak{a}\\\\) using the elements of \\\\(R\\\\) and the ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) itself. The operations in the factor ring are defined based on the elements of \\\\(R\\\\) and the ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\), without any explicit mention or requirement of a system of generators of \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\).\\n\\n2. **System of Generators of an Ideal Definition**: This concept describes a way to express an ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) as being generated by a family of elements within the ring. It specifies how the ideal can be constructed or represented, but it does not alter the existence or the structure of the ideal itself.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a factor ring \\\\(R / \\mathfrak{a}\\\\) relies on the existence and properties of the ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\), but not on how \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) is generated. The factor ring can be defined and understood completely without reference to a system of generators of the ideal. Therefore, knowing or defining a system of generators for \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) is not a prerequisite for defining or understanding the concept of a factor ring.",
