                "Explanation": "The concept of a submodule involves a subset of a module that is closed under the operations of the module, specifically addition and scalar multiplication by elements of the ring A. This definition requires that for any elements x, y in the submodule and any scalar a in A, the results of x+y and a*x must also be in the submodule. It does not inherently require any specific properties of the elements of the submodule in relation to the ring A, other than closure under the operations defined by the module.\\n\\nThe concept of a torsion element, on the other hand, involves an element of the module that satisfies a specific condition related to the ring A: there exists a nonzero element a in A such that a*x = 0. This concept is related to the specific behavior of elements within the module under scalar multiplication by elements of A.\\n\\nThe definition of a submodule does not depend on whether its elements are torsion or not. Submodules can be entirely composed of torsion elements, entirely of non-torsion elements, or a mix of both. The essential properties defining a submodule are closure under addition and scalar multiplication, not the torsion properties of its elements. Therefore, the concept of a torsion element is not necessary for the definition of a submodule to make sense.",
