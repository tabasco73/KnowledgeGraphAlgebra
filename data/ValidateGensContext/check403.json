                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Ring Extension is necessary for the definition of a Principal Ideal Domain (PID) to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Principal Ideal Domain (PID):** A ring $R$ is called a principal ideal domain if it is an integral domain and every ideal of $R$ is principal. This definition focuses on the properties of a single ring $R$ and its ideals. It specifies that $R$ must be an integral domain (a commutative ring with no zero divisors) and that every ideal within $R$ must be generated by a single element.\\n\\n2. **Ring Extension:** The pair (S, R), where S is a subring of R, is called a ring extension. This concept involves two rings, $S$ and $R$, where $S$ is a subset of $R$.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a PID is self-contained and does not inherently require the notion of a ring extension. The definition of a PID focuses solely on the internal structure and properties of one ring, without reference to its relationship with another ring or subring. Therefore, the concept of a ring extension is not necessary for the definition of a PID to make sense.",
