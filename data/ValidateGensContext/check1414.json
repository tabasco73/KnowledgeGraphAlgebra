                "Explanation": "The concept of the characteristic of a field pertains to the nature of the arithmetic within that field, specifically whether it behaves like the integers modulo some prime number (in the case of a finite characteristic) or like the rational numbers (in the case of characteristic zero). This characteristic influences the structure and properties of the field but does not directly impact the definition or the understanding of the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting field.\\n\\nThe Galois group of a polynomial's splitting field is defined as the group of automorphisms of the splitting field that fix the base field and permute the roots of the polynomial. This definition and the concept itself focus on the symmetries and automorphisms of the field extensions created by the roots of the polynomial, rather than the arithmetic properties of the field such as its characteristic.\\n\\nTherefore, while the characteristic of a field can influence the behavior of polynomials and their roots in that field (for example, in characteristic 2, the equation x^2 = x has more solutions than it would in a field of characteristic 0), it is not a necessary concept to define or understand the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting fields. The Galois group can be studied and understood independently of the field's characteristic.",
