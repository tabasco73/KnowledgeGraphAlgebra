                "Explanation": "The definition of a subring requires that the subset S of a ring R must be a subgroup with respect to addition and a submonoid with respect to multiplication. This implies that the operations within S must follow the same rules as those in R, including the associative law, since R is a ring and must adhere to the associative law for both addition and multiplication.\\n\\nFor S to be a subring, it must inherit the properties of R, including the associative nature of its operations. Therefore, the associative law is inherently required for the operations in R, and by extension in S, to function correctly as a ring. Without the associative law being defined and applicable in R, the concept of S as a subring would not make sense because it could not guarantee the associative property necessary for ring operations.\\n\\nThus, the associative law must be defined and understood for the definition of a subring to be meaningful and accurate, as it ensures that the subset S will also exhibit the necessary associative properties in its operations.",
