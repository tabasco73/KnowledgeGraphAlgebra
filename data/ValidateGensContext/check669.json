                "Explanation": "The definition of an Irreducible Polynomial explicitly references a polynomial ring R[X], stating that a polynomial f in R[X] is irreducible if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials in R[X]. This definition inherently relies on the concept of a polynomial ring to provide the context and structure in which the polynomial f exists and is evaluated for irreducibility. Without the concept of a polynomial ring, the definition of an irreducible polynomial would lack the necessary framework to specify what constitutes the polynomials being factored and the operations allowed on these polynomials. Therefore, the concept of a polynomial ring is essential for the definition of an irreducible polynomial to be meaningful and applicable.",
