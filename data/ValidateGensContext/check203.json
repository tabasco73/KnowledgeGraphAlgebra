A subgroup, by definition, is itself a group. Therefore, it must satisfy all the group axioms, which include closure, identity, inverses, and associativity.\\n\\n2. The definition of a subgroup generated by a set involves the operation of the group $G$ from which it is derived. This operation in $G$ must be associative because $G$ is a group.\\n\\n3. The elements of the subgroup generated by a set are formed by finite products and inverses of elements from the set $X$. For the operations within this subgroup to be well-defined and for the subgroup to satisfy the group axioms (including associativity), the original group operation must be associative.\\n\\n4. If the operation in $G$ were not associative, then the operation within any subgroup, including those generated by a set, would not necessarily be associative, potentially violating the group axioms and thus not forming a valid group.\\n\\n5. Therefore, the Associative Law is essential in the underlying group $G$ to ensure that any subgroup, including those generated by a set, also respects the Associative Law and thus qualifies as a group.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Associative Law must be defined and valid in the original group $G$ for the concept of a subgroup generated by a set to make sense and for such a subgroup to adhere to the group axioms, including associativity.",
