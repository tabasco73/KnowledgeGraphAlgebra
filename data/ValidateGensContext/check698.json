                "Explanation": "The concept of an Empty Product is defined within the context of a monoid and specifically refers to the unit element of the monoid. This definition does not require any understanding or application of the concept of the Order of an element, which pertains to the properties of an element in a group, specifically the smallest positive integer that brings the element back to the identity element in a cyclic group context.\\n\\nThe definition of an Empty Product is self-contained and only requires the knowledge of the unit element in a monoid. It does not depend on or require the concept of the Order of an element, which deals with cyclic properties of elements in a group, not the basic structure of a monoid or the properties of its unit element. Therefore, the concept of the Order of an element is not necessary for the definition of an Empty Product to make sense.",
