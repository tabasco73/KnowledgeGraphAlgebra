                "Explanation": "The concept of a transposition, as defined, refers to a 2-cycle, which is a specific type of permutation in the context of group theory, particularly within the symmetric group on a set. A transposition swaps two elements and leaves all others fixed. This concept inherently relies on the notion of permutations, which are bijective functions from a set to itself.\\n\\nThe law of composition, on the other hand, defines a binary operation on a set, mapping pairs of elements from the set to another element within the same set. This operation is essential in defining structures like groups, rings, and fields, where the operation must satisfy certain properties like associativity, identity, and inverses.\\n\\nTo understand a transposition, one needs to understand permutations and their properties, such as being bijective functions. However, understanding permutations does not necessarily require the concept of a law of composition as defined. The law of composition is more about defining operations within algebraic structures and is not specifically required to define what a transposition is in the context of permutations.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a law of composition is not necessary to define a transposition. A transposition can be understood purely within the framework of permutations without reference to a binary operation defined by a law of composition.",
