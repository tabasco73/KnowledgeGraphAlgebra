                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Ring Automorphism, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Ring Automorphism**: Defined as an isomorphism from a ring $R$ to itself. An isomorphism, in the context of rings, is a bijective function that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication).\\n\\n2. **Ring**: Implicit in the definition of a Ring Automorphism is the concept of a ring, which is a set equipped with two operations: addition and multiplication. These operations are examples of laws of composition, as they map pairs of elements from the ring to another element in the ring (i.e., $(a, b) \\rightarrow a + b$ and $(a, b) \\rightarrow a \\times b$).\\n\\n3. **Law of Composition**: Defined as a map from $M \\times M$ to $M$, assigning a product to each pair. This is exactly what the operations in a ring do.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Law of Composition is fundamental to the definition of a ring, and consequently, to the definition of a Ring Automorphism. Without laws of composition, the operations within a ring cannot be defined, and without these operations, the concept of an isomorphism (and thus an automorphism) of a ring would not make sense.",
