The definition of a left coset explicitly states that it is a subset of $G$ of the form $aH = \\{ah; h \\in H\\}$, where $a \\in G$. This means that a left coset is not just any collection of elements, but specifically a collection that must satisfy the condition of being a subset of $G$.\\n\\n2. The definition of a subset is that it is a set where all of its elements are also contained within another set. This is crucial in understanding what it means for $aH$ to be a subset of $G$; it implies that every element $ah$ (where $h \\in H$ and $a \\in G$) must also be an element of $G$.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a subset, the definition of a left coset would lose its meaning as it specifically requires that $aH$ be a subset of $G$. The relationship and properties that define a left coset rely on the understanding that it is a subset according to the given definition of a subset.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a subset is essential for the definition of a left coset to make sense, as it establishes the foundational relationship between $aH$ and $G$.",
