            "Let $G$ be a monoid. A subset $H \\subset G$ is called a submonoid if $H$ satisfies the following conditions: (i) $e \\in H$, (ii) $a, b \\in H \\Longrightarrow a b \\in H$. If $G$ is a group, $H$ is called a subgroup of $G$ if in addition, (iii) $a \\in H \\Longrightarrow a^{-1} \\in H$. In particular, a subgroup of a group $G$ is a submonoid that is closed under the process of taking inverses. In defining a subgroup $H \\subset G$, condition (i) can be weakened by simply requiring $H \\neq \\emptyset$, since this implies $e \\in H$ using (ii) and (iii). Of course, similar reasoning is not possible for monoids. Every group $G$ admits $\\{e\\}$ and $G$ as trivial subgroups. Given $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the set $m \\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all integral multiples of $m$ is a subgroup of the additive group $\\mathbb{Z}$. We will see in 1.3/4 that all subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are of this type. More generally, every element $a$ of a group $G$ gives rise to a so-called cyclic subgroup of $G$. It consists of all powers $a^{n}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where we put $a^{n}=\\left(a^{-1}\\right)^{-n}$ for $n<0; see also Section 1.3."

                "Explanation": "The concept of a Submodule is defined in the context of modules, which are algebraic structures similar to vector spaces but over a ring instead of a field. A submodule is a subset of a module that is closed under the operations of the module, specifically addition and scalar multiplication by elements of the ring. This definition is analogous to that of a subspace in vector spaces but does not inherently require the concept of a subgroup.\\n\\nThe concept of a Subgroup, on the other hand, pertains to groups, which are algebraic structures consisting of a set equipped with a single binary operation that satisfies certain axioms (associativity, identity element, and inverses). A subgroup is a subset of a group that itself forms a group under the same operation. The definition of a subgroup involves closure under the group operation and the existence of inverses, which are specific to group theory.\\n\\nThus, the definition of a submodule does not depend on the concept of a subgroup. Submodules relate to modules and the operations defined on them (addition and scalar multiplication), while subgroups relate to groups and the properties of their binary operation. The two concepts operate within different algebraic frameworks and are independent in their definitions and applications.",
