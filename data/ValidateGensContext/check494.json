                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Isomorphism involves a bijective ring homomorphism between two rings, ensuring that the structure and operations of the rings are preserved under the mapping. This definition focuses on the properties of the mapping being bijective and the preservation of addition and multiplication operations.\\n\\nThe concept of a Zero Divisor, on the other hand, pertains to the existence of certain elements within a ring that when multiplied by non-zero elements result in zero. This concept is related to the internal structure of the ring itself and does not directly influence the definition or the properties of a ring isomorphism.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding or defining zero divisors is not necessary for the definition or understanding of a ring isomorphism. The existence or non-existence of zero divisors does not affect the bijectiveness or the homomorphic properties required for a mapping to be an isomorphism.",
