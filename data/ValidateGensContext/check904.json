                "Explanation": "The concept of an Alternating Group involves permutations of a set, specifically focusing on even permutations of the elements from 1 to n. Permutations are bijective functions from a set to itself, where each element is mapped to another element in the set. The definition of a permutation inherently involves the concept of a function, as it is a rearrangement of elements within a set.\\n\\nThe concept of a Codomain is related to functions, defining the set of all possible outputs a function can have. However, in the context of permutations, and thus in the definition of an Alternating Group, the codomain is implicitly the same as the domain (the set being permuted). Therefore, while the concept of a codomain is relevant to understanding functions in general, it is not specifically required to define or understand an Alternating Group. The definition of an Alternating Group is complete with the understanding of permutations (functions from a set to itself) and does not require a separate definition or understanding of a codomain beyond this context.",
