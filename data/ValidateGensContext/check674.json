                "Explanation": "The definition of a p-group focuses on the order of the group being a power of a prime number. It does not require any specific notation or method for combining elements of the group, such as the product notation in monoids. The concept of a p-group is concerned with the structure and properties of the group related to its order, not the specific operations within the group.\\n\\nThe product notation in monoids is a way to express the operation of combining multiple elements in a monoid, which is an associative algebraic structure with an identity element. While groups are a type of monoid, the definition of a p-group does not depend on how the elements are combined or expressed; it solely depends on the number of elements in the group (its order) being a power of a prime number.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of product notation in monoids is not necessary for the definition of a p-group to make sense. The definition of a p-group can be fully understood and applied without reference to the specific method of element combination provided by product notation in monoids.",
