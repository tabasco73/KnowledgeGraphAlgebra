                "Explanation": "To define the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension, the concept of a Field Extension is essential. The definition of the Galois Group explicitly references a finite field extension $\\mathbb{F}_{q'} / \\mathbb{F}_q$, which is a specific case of a field extension where $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a subfield of $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$. Without understanding what a field extension is, one cannot comprehend the structure or the elements (automorphisms) of the Galois Group, as these automorphisms are defined based on their action on the field extension. Therefore, the concept of a Field Extension is necessary to properly define and understand the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension.",
