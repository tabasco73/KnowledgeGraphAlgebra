                "Explanation": "The concept of the kernel of a map, as defined, involves the set of all elements in the domain of a function that map to the identity element (in this case, 0) of the codomain. This definition is independent of the size or number of elements in the domain or any group; it solely depends on the properties of the function and its behavior on elements of the domain.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the order of a group refers to the total number of elements in a group, which is a concept related to the structure and classification of groups themselves, not directly to the behavior of a function mapping elements between sets or groups.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding or defining the kernel of a map does not require knowledge of the order of a group. The kernel's definition is self-contained with respect to the function's properties and does not involve the group's order.",
