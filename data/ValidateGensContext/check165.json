                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring Extension is necessary for the definition of a Ring Epimorphism, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. **Ring Epimorphism**: Defined as a surjective ring homomorphism from one ring R to another ring R'. This definition requires understanding of rings, ring homomorphisms, and the concept of surjectivity. It involves a mapping from one ring to another where every element of the target ring is the image of at least one element of the source ring.\\n\\n2. **Ring Extension**: Defined as a pair (S, R) where S is a subring of R. This concept involves a relationship between two rings where one ring is a subset of the other and retains the ring operations.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Ring Epimorphism focuses on the properties of a function between two rings, specifically its surjectivity. The concept of a Ring Extension, on the other hand, deals with the inclusion relationship between two rings, where one is a subring of the other.\\n\\nThus, the concept of a Ring Extension is not necessary for the definition of a Ring Epimorphism. The definition of a Ring Epimorphism does not rely on or require the concept of one ring being a subring of another, but rather on the properties of a mapping between any two rings.",
