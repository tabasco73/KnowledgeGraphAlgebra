                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Field Extension is necessary for defining a Normal field extension, we need to analyze the dependencies between the two concepts based on their definitions.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Normal field extension explicitly mentions an 'extension field' and uses the notation \\(K \\subset L\\), indicating a relationship where \\(L\\) is an extension of \\(K\\). This directly refers to the concept of a Field Extension, where \\(K\\) is a subfield of \\(L\\).\\n\\n2. The properties and conditions described in the definition of a Normal field extension (such as being a splitting field, the behavior of \\(K\\)-homomorphisms, and the decomposition of polynomials) all presuppose that there is an established relationship of one field being an extension of another, which is precisely what is defined in the concept of a Field Extension.\\n\\n3. Without understanding what a Field Extension is (i.e., one field being a subfield of another), the conditions and properties used to define a Normal field extension would not make sense, as they rely on the existence of this relationship.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Field Extension is essential for the definition of a Normal field extension to be meaningful and complete.",
