            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Factor Group inherently relies on the concept of a Group. The Factor Group is defined as a set of cosets of a normal subgroup $N$ in a group $G$, with a specific group operation. This definition presupposes the existence of a group $G$ and a subgroup $N$ which itself must also be a group. Without the concept of a Group, the notion of a subgroup, and hence a normal subgroup, would not exist. Furthermore, the operations and properties (like associativity, identity, and inverses) used in defining the Factor Group are derived from the properties of a Group. Therefore, understanding and defining a Factor Group is contingent upon first understanding what a Group is.",
