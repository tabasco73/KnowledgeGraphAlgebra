                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a system of generators is necessary for the definition of a free system of generators (basis) to make sense, we need to analyze the relationship between these two concepts.\\n\\n1. A system of generators for an A-module M is defined as a family of elements (x_i)_{i in I} such that every element in M can be expressed as a linear combination of these elements. This means that the set of generators spans the module M.\\n\\n2. A free system of generators (basis) for an A-module M is defined as a family of elements (x_i)_{i in I} that is not only spanning M (as every element in M can be expressed as a linear combination of these elements) but also linearly independent. Linear independence is defined such that if a linear combination of these elements results in zero, then all the coefficients in this combination must be zero.\\n\\n3. From the definitions, it is clear that a free system of generators (basis) inherently includes the property of being a system of generators since it spans the module M. However, it adds the additional property of linear independence.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a system of generators is implicitly required for the definition of a free system of generators because the latter is an extension of the former. The concept of a free system of generators (basis) would not make sense without first understanding what it means for a set of elements to generate a module (system of generators).",
