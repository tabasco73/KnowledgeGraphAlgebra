                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of a 'Simple Field Extension' to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definition of a simple field extension.\\n\\n1. The definition of a simple field extension involves the statement '$K \\subset L$ is called simple if there exists an element $\\alpha \\in L$ such that $L=K(\\alpha)$.'\\n2. The notation '$\\alpha \\in L$' explicitly uses the concept of an element of a set, indicating that $\\alpha$ is an object that belongs to the set $L$.\\n3. The entire definition of a simple field extension hinges on the existence of such an element $\\alpha$ in the set $L$ which can generate the field $L$ when adjoined to $K$.\\n4. Without understanding what it means for $\\alpha$ to be an element of the set $L', the definition of a simple field extension would not be meaningful or complete because it would be unclear what it means for $\\alpha$ to belong to $L$.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is crucial and necessary for the definition of a 'Simple Field Extension' to be understood and applied correctly.",
