                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field Extension involves a pair of fields, $K$ and $L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This definition inherently assumes that both $K$ and $L$ are fields. By the definition of a field, it must be a set equipped with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties, including the associative law for both operations. Therefore, the associative law is already a fundamental part of the structure of any field, including both $K$ and $L$ in the context of a field extension.\\n\\nThus, the associative law does not need to be separately defined or stated in the definition of a field extension, as it is an intrinsic property of the fields themselves. The definition of a field extension implicitly assumes the existence of the associative law through the requirement that $K$ and $L$ are fields. Therefore, the associative law is necessary for the concept of fields, but it does not need to be explicitly defined or mentioned in the definition of a field extension, as it is already encompassed within the definition of fields.",
