                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Commutative Ring is necessary for the definition of an Extension Field, we need to analyze the definitions and dependencies of these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Extension Field**: An extension field is a type of field, specifically a field with a certain number of elements derived from a prime base and a positive integer exponent. The definition involves concepts of fields, prime numbers, and polynomials.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Commutative Ring**: A commutative ring is defined as a ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. This definition pertains to the algebraic structure of rings, focusing on the commutativity of multiplication.\\n\\n3. **Relationship between Fields and Rings**: A field is a special kind of ring that not only satisfies the ring axioms (including having a commutative multiplication operation) but also requires every non-zero element to have a multiplicative inverse. Thus, every field is inherently a commutative ring.\\n\\n4. **Necessity of Commutative Ring Concept for Extension Field**: While the concept of a field inherently includes the properties of a commutative ring, the specific concept of a commutative ring as defined does not need to be explicitly understood or defined to grasp the concept of an extension field. The definition of an extension field relies directly on the properties of fields and does not require a separate or prior understanding of commutative rings beyond what is already included in the definition of a field.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a commutative ring, while related, is not necessary for the definition of an extension field. The essential properties of commutative rings are already encompassed within the broader and more specific properties of fields, which are directly relevant to the definition of extension fields.",
