                "Explanation": "The definition of a reduced ideal involves the concept of the radical of an ideal, which is defined independently of the structure of the ring being a Principal Ideal Domain (PID). The radical of an ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) in a ring \\\\(R\\\\) is the set of all elements \\\\(a \\\\in R\\\\) such that there exists some \\\\(n \\\\in \\mathbb{N}\\\\) with \\\\(a^n \\\\in \\mathfrak{a}\\\\). This definition does not require the ring \\\\(R\\\\) to be a PID, nor does it rely on every ideal being principal. A PID is a specific type of ring where every ideal is principal and the ring itself is an integral domain, but these properties are not necessary to define or understand the concept of a reduced ideal. Therefore, the concept of a PID is not needed for the definition of a reduced ideal to make sense.",
