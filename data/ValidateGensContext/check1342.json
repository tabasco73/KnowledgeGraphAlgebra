            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Free system of generators (basis) specifically refers to an A-module M. An A-module, by definition, is a generalization of the concept of a vector space, where the scalars (coefficients) belong to a ring A instead of a field. This means that the elements a_i in the definition of a free system of generators are elements of a ring A. Therefore, the concept of a ring is fundamental to defining what an A-module is, and consequently, it is essential for defining a free system of generators (basis) for such a module. Without the concept of a ring, the notion of an A-module and hence the concept of a free system of generators (basis) would not be well-defined or meaningful.",
