                "Explanation": "To understand the concept of a Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension, it is essential to first comprehend what a field is, as the definition of the Galois group directly involves fields. The definition of the Galois group mentions it as the group of field automorphisms of $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ that fix $\\mathbb{F}_q$, where both $\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are fields. The concept of a field is fundamental here because without knowing what a field is, one cannot understand the nature of the objects ($\\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_q$) being discussed or the operations (automorphisms) that are permissible on them. Moreover, the properties of fields, such as being a commutative division ring, are crucial to defining what kinds of transformations (automorphisms) can exist and how they behave. Therefore, the concept of a field is necessary to define and understand the Galois Group of a Finite Field Extension.",
