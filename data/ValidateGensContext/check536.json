                "Explanation": "The concept of a Monoid involves a set with an associative binary operation and a unit element. This structure is foundational in abstract algebra but is not directly necessary to define the sum of ideals in a ring. The sum of ideals, as defined, involves adding elements from two ideals within a ring to form a new set. This operation uses the addition inherent in the ring structure, not a separate monoidal structure.\\n\\nTo define the sum of ideals, we only need the ring's addition operation to be well-defined and closed within the ideals, which is guaranteed by the definition of ideals in a ring. The ring itself, under addition, forms a group (specifically, an abelian group), and this suffices for the operation of summing ideals. The monoid concept, involving a general associative operation with an identity, does not need to be invoked specifically for defining the sum of ideals, as the necessary properties are already covered by the ring's structure.",
