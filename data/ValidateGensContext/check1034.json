                "Explanation": "The definition of the length of an A-module explicitly relies on the concept of submodules. According to the definition, the length of an A-module M, denoted l_A(M), is the supremum of the lengths of chains of submodules starting from the zero module and ending at M. Each step in the chain involves a submodule that is strictly contained in the next submodule, culminating in the module M itself. Without the concept of submodules, it would be impossible to form these chains, as there would be no subsets of M that are closed under the operations of M and thus no way to measure the length of such chains. Therefore, the concept of a submodule is essential for defining the length of an A-module.",
