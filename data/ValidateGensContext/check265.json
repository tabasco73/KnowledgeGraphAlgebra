                "Explanation": "The concept of the Sum of Ideals involves adding elements from two ideals within a ring to form a new set. This operation is defined without any explicit requirement for the elements of the ring to commute under multiplication, as it solely involves the addition of elements from each ideal. The definition of the Sum of Ideals does not rely on the multiplication properties of the elements, but rather on their additive properties.\\n\\nThe Commutative Law, on the other hand, specifically pertains to the commutation of elements under a binary operation, typically multiplication in the context of ring theory. This law states that the operation is commutative if the order of the operands does not affect the result of the operation.\\n\\nIn the context of defining the Sum of Ideals, the Commutative Law related to multiplication is irrelevant. The definition of the Sum of Ideals only requires that the addition operation in the ring be well-defined and that the ring itself adheres to the properties of an additive group (associativity, identity, and inverses for addition). These properties do not necessitate the multiplication operation to be commutative. Therefore, the Commutative Law does not need to be defined or assumed for the definition of the Sum of Ideals to make sense.",
