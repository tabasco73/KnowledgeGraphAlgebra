(ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of an Algebraic subset involves the concept of a polynomial ring, specifically mentioned as 'K[X]=K[X_1, ..., X_n]'. A polynomial ring is a type of ring, which is defined by the operations of addition and multiplication that satisfy certain properties such as associativity, distributivity, and the existence of a unit element. These properties are essential characteristics of a ring, as defined in the provided definition of a ring. Therefore, understanding and defining a polynomial ring inherently requires the concept of a ring. Since the definition of an Algebraic subset relies on the concept of a polynomial ring, the concept of a ring must be defined and understood first to make sense of what an Algebraic subset is. Thus, the concept of a ring is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic subset to be meaningful and complete.",
