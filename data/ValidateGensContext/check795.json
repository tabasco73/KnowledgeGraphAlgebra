                "Explanation": "The concept of a Purely Inseparable Extension involves field extensions and the properties of polynomials over these fields. Specifically, it deals with the nature of the roots of minimal polynomials in the extension field. The definition focuses on the behavior of elements within the field and their algebraic characteristics over the base field.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Subring pertains to the structure within a ring, where a subset of the ring forms another ring under the same operations. This concept is more general and applies to any ring, not specifically to fields or field extensions.\\n\\nTo understand or define a Purely Inseparable Extension, one needs to consider properties of fields and polynomials, not the structure of subrings. The definition of a Purely Inseparable Extension does not rely on or require the concept of a subring. It is focused on the properties of field extensions and does not involve the internal ring structure that subrings describe.",
