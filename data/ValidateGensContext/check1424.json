                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Field Extension is necessary for defining a Simple Field Extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Simple Field Extension explicitly states that it is a type of field extension, specifically where $K \\subset L$ and there exists an element $\\alpha \\in L$ such that $L=K(\\alpha)$. This definition inherently assumes the existence of a field extension, as it refers to $K \\subset L$.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Field Extension describes it as a pair of fields $K \\subset L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This sets the foundational concept of what it means for one field to be an extension of another.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a Field Extension, the term $K \\subset L$ used in the definition of a Simple Field Extension would lack context and clarity. The understanding that $L$ is an extension of $K$ (i.e., $L$ includes $K$ and possibly more elements) is crucial for making sense of what it means for $L$ to be generated by $K$ and an additional element $\\alpha$.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a Field Extension provides the necessary framework and terminology for defining what a Simple Field Extension is. Without this foundational concept, the definition of a Simple Field Extension would be incomplete and not fully understandable.",
