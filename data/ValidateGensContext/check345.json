                "Explanation": "The concept of the order of an element in a group involves finding the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $a^m = 1$, where $a$ is an element of the group $G$. This definition is concerned with the properties of a single element $a$ and its powers within the group. It does not require that the operation in the group be commutative; that is, it does not require that $ab = ba$ for all $a, b$ in the group. The order of an element can be defined and calculated in both commutative (abelian) and non-commutative (non-abelian) groups. Therefore, the commutative law, which states that the operation must satisfy $ab = ba$ for all elements, is not necessary for the concept of the order of an element to make sense. The order of an element is a concept that depends on the group's operation being associative and having an identity element, but not necessarily on it being commutative.",
