                "Explanation": "The concept of a trivial algebraic field extension, where every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$, is not a prerequisite for defining the Galois group of a field extension. The definition of the Galois group focuses on the automorphisms of $L$ that fix every element of $K$, irrespective of whether every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$ or not. The key requirement for a field extension $L / K$ to have a Galois group is that the extension should be normal and separable, not necessarily that it be trivial (where trivial is defined as every element of $L$ being algebraic over $K$). Thus, the concept of a trivial algebraic field extension is not necessary for the definition of a Galois group of a field extension.",
