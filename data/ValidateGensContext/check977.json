More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a group is necessary for the definition of a cyclic group to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a cyclic group explicitly mentions and relies on the concept of a group. It states that a group $G$ is called cyclic if it is generated by a single element. This implies that the structure and properties of $G$ as a group are prerequisites for understanding what it means for it to be cyclic.\\n\\n2. The definition of a group provides the foundational properties and operations that define what a group is, including associativity, the existence of a unit element, and the existence of inverses for each element. These properties are essential for any further discussion or specification of types of groups, including cyclic groups.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a group, the notion of a cyclic group would lack the necessary context for its properties and operations, as the definition of a cyclic group assumes knowledge of what a group is and how it operates.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a group is indeed necessary for the definition of a cyclic group to make sense, as it provides the fundamental framework within which the properties of a cyclic group are defined and understood.",
