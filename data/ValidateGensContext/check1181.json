                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Commutative Ring is necessary for the definition of a Sum of Ideals to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Sum of Ideals involves two ideals, \\(\\mathfrak{a}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{b}\\), in a ring \\(R\\). The sum \\(\\mathfrak{a}+\\mathfrak{b}\\) is defined as the set of all elements of the form \\(a+b\\), where \\(a \\in \\mathfrak{a}\\) and \\(b \\in \\mathfrak{b}\\).\\n\\n2. The definition of a Commutative Ring specifies that a ring \\(R\\) is commutative if its multiplication operation is commutative. This definition pertains specifically to the multiplication operation within the ring.\\n\\n3. The definition of the Sum of Ideals does not reference or require the multiplication operation to be commutative. It solely involves the addition of elements from two ideals within the ring.\\n\\n4. Since the definition of the Sum of Ideals only requires the existence of a ring (not specifically a commutative ring) and uses the addition operation (which is always commutative in rings), the commutativity of the multiplication operation in the ring is irrelevant to this definition.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Commutative Ring is not necessary for the definition of a Sum of Ideals to make sense. The definition of a Sum of Ideals can be applied in any ring, whether commutative or not, as long as the ring supports the basic operations of addition and multiplication (to define ideals).",
