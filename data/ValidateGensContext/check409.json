This definition requires only the concepts of a group and a subgroup, and does not depend on any additional properties of the group, such as whether it is solvable or not.\\n\\nThe concept of a Solvable group, on the other hand, involves a specific type of group that has a particular chain of subgroups with each quotient being abelian. This concept is more specific and pertains to the internal structure and properties of the group itself.\\n\\nSince the definition of a Left Coset does not require the group to have any specific properties like solvability, and only requires the basic group structure and the existence of subgroups, the concept of a Solvable group is not necessary for the definition of a Left Coset to make sense.",
