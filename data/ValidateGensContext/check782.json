                "Explanation": "Kronecker's Construction involves the use of a polynomial ring and the formation of a quotient of this ring by an ideal. A polynomial ring is a type of ring, and for the construction to work properly, the operations within this ring, including multiplication, need to follow the commutative property. This is because the polynomial ring is built upon the base field, and fields are inherently commutative under multiplication. Therefore, the concept of a commutative ring is inherently used in defining the polynomial ring which is essential in Kronecker's Construction. Without the property of commutativity in the ring, the operations and the resulting structure might not hold as expected in the context of field theory and polynomial algebra used in Kronecker's Construction.",
