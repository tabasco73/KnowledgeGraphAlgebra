                "Explanation": "The definition of a Group Homomorphism involves a function between two groups that preserves the group operation. Specifically, the condition (ii) in the definition of a Group Homomorphism, $\\\\(\\varphi(ab) = \\varphi(a)\\varphi(b)\\\\)$ for all \\\\(a, b \\\\in G\\\\), directly references the group operation, which is a law of composition. This operation \\\\(ab\\\\) is defined by the law of composition in the group \\\\(G\\\\). Similarly, \\\\(\\varphi(a)\\varphi(b)\\\\) uses the law of composition in the group \\\\(G'\\\\). Therefore, the concept of a law of composition must be defined and understood for the operation within each group, making it essential for the definition of a Group Homomorphism to make sense. Without a law of composition, the operation \\\\(ab\\\\) and consequently \\\\(\\varphi(ab)\\\\) would not have any meaning, as there would be no defined way to 'multiply' or combine elements of the groups.",
