                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Cyclic group, we need to analyze the components of each definition.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Cyclic group states that it is a group generated by a single element. This implies that there is a set with a group structure, which inherently includes a binary operation (law of composition) that satisfies certain properties like associativity, identity, and inverses.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Law of Composition describes a binary operation on a set, mapping pairs of elements from the set to another element in the same set. This operation is essential for defining the structure of a group, as it is the operation that combines elements of the group.\\n\\n3. Since a Cyclic group is a type of group, and a group by definition requires a binary operation (law of composition) to define how elements are combined, the concept of a Law of Composition is indeed necessary for the definition of a Cyclic group. Without a law of composition, we cannot define the group operation, and thus cannot define what it means for a group to be generated by a single element.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Cyclic group to make sense, as it provides the fundamental operation that allows the group structure to exist and be described.",
