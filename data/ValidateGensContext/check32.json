                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Field Extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Field Extension involves a pair of fields $K \\subset L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This definition inherently assumes that both $K$ and $L$ are fields.\\n\\n2. The definition of a field (not explicitly given here but commonly understood in mathematics) includes the requirement that the field must have two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties. These operations are examples of laws of composition, as they map pairs of elements from the field to another element in the field (e.g., $(a, b) \\mapsto a + b$ and $(a, b) \\mapsto a \\cdot b$).\\n\\n3. Therefore, the existence of a field, and by extension a Field Extension, presupposes the existence of laws of composition (specifically addition and multiplication) that define how elements of the field interact.\\n\\n4. Without laws of composition, the structures of $K$ and $L$ would not meet the definition of a field, and thus the concept of a Field Extension would not make sense.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Field Extension to be meaningful, as it underpins the fundamental operations within fields that allow them to be defined as such.",
