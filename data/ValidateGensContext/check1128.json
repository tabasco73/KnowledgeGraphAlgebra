            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a Field of Fractions explicitly requires the concept of an integral domain, which is a special kind of ring. An integral domain is defined as a commutative ring with unity (1 \u2260 0) that has no zero divisors. Therefore, understanding what a ring is becomes essential because an integral domain is a subset of rings with additional properties.\\n\\nSince the Field of Fractions is constructed from an integral domain, and an integral domain cannot be defined without first defining what a ring is, the concept of a ring is indeed necessary for the definition of a Field of Fractions to make sense. Without the foundational concept of a ring, the properties and structure of an integral domain, and consequently the Field of Fractions, cannot be established.",
