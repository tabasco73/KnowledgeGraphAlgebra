                "Explanation": "To understand the relationship between the concept of an 'Element of a Set' and the 'Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields', we need to analyze the definitions and their interdependencies:\\n\\n1. The definition of the Galois group involves the concept of a splitting field, which is a type of field extension containing all roots (elements) of a polynomial. This field is essentially a set of elements.\\n\\n2. Automorphisms in the context of the Galois group are mappings from the splitting field to itself that preserve the structure of the field. These mappings inherently involve elements of the set (splitting field) since they must map each element to another element within the same set.\\n\\n3. The automorphisms permute the roots of the polynomial. Roots of a polynomial are specific elements of the splitting field. Therefore, understanding what elements are and how they can be manipulated or mapped is crucial.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of an 'Element of a Set', we cannot properly define what it means for automorphisms to act on the splitting field, as there would be no clear definition of what constitutes the objects being permuted or mapped.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is fundamental in defining and understanding the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting fields. Without this concept, the actions of the automorphisms and the very structure of the splitting field would not be well-defined.",
