            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a 'System of Generators of an Ideal' explicitly mentions that it pertains to an ideal of a ring $R$. An ideal is a subset of a ring that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of the ring. Therefore, the concept of an ideal inherently depends on the structure of a ring. Without the concept of a ring, the notion of an ideal cannot be defined, and consequently, a system of generators of an ideal, which relies on the existence and properties of an ideal, also cannot be defined. Thus, the concept of a ring is essential for the definition of a system of generators of an ideal to make sense.",
