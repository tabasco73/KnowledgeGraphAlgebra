                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for the definition of the 'Image of a Ring Homomorphism' to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of the 'Image of a Ring Homomorphism' involves the mapping of elements from one ring $R$ to another ring $R'$ via a ring homomorphism $\\\\(\\varphi\\\\). The image is defined as $\\varphi(R)$, which implies that it consists of the set of all values $\\varphi(r)$ where $r$ is an element of $R$.\\n\\n2. The concept of an 'Element of a Set' is defined as an object belonging to a set. This concept is implicitly used in the definition of the image of a ring homomorphism because it involves considering the elements $r$ of the ring $R$ and mapping them to elements $\\varphi(r)$ in the ring $R'$.\\n\\n3. Without understanding what it means for something to be an element of a set, we cannot properly understand the mapping of elements from $R$ to $R'$, nor can we understand the composition of the set $\\varphi(R)$, which is defined as a collection of such elements.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is fundamental in understanding and defining the 'Image of a Ring Homomorphism' because it underpins the notion of mapping elements and forming sets of these mapped elements.",
