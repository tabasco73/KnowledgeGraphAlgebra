                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition needs to be defined for a Factor Group to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Factor Group involves the formation of a group from the set of left cosets of a normal subgroup $N$ in a group $G$. The operation defined on the factor group $G / N$ is given by $(aN) \\times (bN) = (ab)N$ for $a, b \\text{ in } G$. This operation takes pairs of elements from $G / N$ and maps them to another element in $G / N$, satisfying the closure property of a group.\\n\\n2. The Law of Composition is defined as a map from $M \\times M$ to $M$, where $M$ is any set, and the operation is characterized by $(a, b) \\rightarrow a \\times b$. This definition is essential for understanding how operations are structured in any set, including groups.\\n\\n3. The operation defined in the Factor Group $(aN) \\times (bN) = (ab)N$ clearly fits the definition of a Law of Composition, as it is a rule for combining pairs of elements (cosets in this case) to form another element (coset) in the same set $G / N$.\\n\\n4. Without the concept of a Law of Composition, the operation defined in the Factor Group would lack a formal framework for understanding how elements are combined, and whether such combinations respect the necessary algebraic properties (like associativity, identity, and inverses) required for a group structure.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary to formally define and understand the group operation in the Factor Group, making it essential for the definition of a Factor Group to make sense.",
