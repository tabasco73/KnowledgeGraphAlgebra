                "Explanation": "The definition of an Alternating Group does not inherently require the concept of an Orbit. The Alternating Group, as defined, is a specific subset of the symmetric group consisting of all even permutations of a set. This definition is based on the properties of permutations and their signs, and does not involve the action of the group on a set, which is central to the concept of an Orbit. An Orbit involves the action of a group on a set and describes the set of elements that can be reached from a given element by the action of any group element. Since the definition of the Alternating Group is self-contained with respect to the properties of permutations and does not require considering group actions on sets, the concept of an Orbit is not necessary for defining or understanding an Alternating Group.",
