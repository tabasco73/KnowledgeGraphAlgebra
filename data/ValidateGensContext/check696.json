                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the order of a group is necessary for the definition of a solvable group, we need to analyze the requirements of the definition of a solvable group. The definition of a solvable group involves a sequence of subgroups where each subgroup is a normal subgroup of the previous one, and the quotient of consecutive subgroups is abelian. This definition focuses on the structure and properties of the subgroups and their relationships, specifically normality and the abelian nature of the quotient groups.\\n\\nThe order of a group, which is the number of elements in the group, does not explicitly appear in the definition of a solvable group. The solvability of a group is determined by the existence of a particular series of subgroups and the properties of these subgroups, not by the number of elements in the group. Therefore, the concept of the order of a group is not necessary to define or understand the concept of a solvable group. The solvability is about the group's algebraic structure rather than its size.",
