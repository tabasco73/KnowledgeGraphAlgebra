The definition of a Purely Inseparable Extension states that it is a type of field extension where the minimal polynomial of any element in the extension has a single root, repeated according to the degree of the polynomial. This definition inherently uses the concept of a field extension as it refers to 'a field extension' directly.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Field Extension is a pair of fields $K \\subset L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This establishes the foundational relationship between two fields where one is an extension of the other.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Field Extension provides the fundamental framework within which a Purely Inseparable Extension is defined. Without understanding what a field extension is, the definition of a purely inseparable extension would lack context and clarity, as it specifically pertains to the behavior of elements within this extension framework.",
