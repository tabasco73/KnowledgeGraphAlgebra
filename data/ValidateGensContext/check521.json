                "Explanation": "The definition of a Group Homomorphism provided explicitly mentions and relies on the concept of monoids. It states that both $G$ and $G'$ must be monoids, each with their respective unit elements, and defines the homomorphism $\\\\(\\varphi\\\\)$ in terms of properties that are fundamental to monoids (preservation of the unit element and the operation). The definition of a monoid is crucial here because it establishes the basic structure and properties (associativity and the existence of a unit element) that are assumed and required for the definition of a monoid homomorphism, which in turn is extended to define a group homomorphism when $G$ and $G'$ are groups. Therefore, without the concept of a monoid, the definition of a group homomorphism would lack the necessary foundational structure and properties, making it incomplete or nonsensical.",
