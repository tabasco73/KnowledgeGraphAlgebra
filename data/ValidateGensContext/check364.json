                "Explanation": "The definition of a Leading Coefficient explicitly references a polynomial, stating that for a polynomial f, the coefficient a_n is called the leading coefficient. This definition inherently relies on the concept of a polynomial, as it specifies that the leading coefficient is a component of a polynomial's formal sum representation. Without the concept of a polynomial, the term 'leading coefficient' would lack context and meaning, as it is directly tied to the structure and components of a polynomial. Therefore, the concept of a polynomial is necessary for the definition of a leading coefficient to be meaningful and applicable.",
