                "Explanation": "A finite field, by definition, is a set with a specific number of elements where operations such as addition and multiplication are defined and follow certain algebraic rules. These operations (addition and multiplication) are examples of laws of composition, as they map pairs of elements from the field back to the field itself, satisfying the closure property. \\n\\nFor a finite field to function as a field, it must have two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that are associative, commutative (addition and multiplication), have identity elements (additive and multiplicative), and every element must have an additive inverse, and every non-zero element must have a multiplicative inverse. These properties are fundamentally based on the concept of a law of composition, which defines how elements combine within the set. \\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a law of composition is essential for the operations within a finite field, making it a necessary part of the definition and structure of a finite field.",
