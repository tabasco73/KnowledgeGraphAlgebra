                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a minimal polynomial is necessary for defining a splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield, we need to analyze the definitions and requirements of each concept.\\n\\n1. **Splitting Field Definition**: A splitting field of a polynomial $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is a field $\\mathbb{F}$ where the polynomial factorizes into linear factors. This definition requires that $\\mathbb{F}$ contains all zeros of $X^q-X$, and each zero appears as a root of a linear factor in the polynomial's factorization within $\\mathbb{F}$.\\n\\n2. **Minimal Polynomial Definition**: The minimal polynomial of an element $\\alpha$ in a field extension is the monic polynomial of lowest degree in the base field that has $\\alpha$ as a root. It is essential for understanding the algebraic structure and properties of $\\alpha$ over the base field, but it specifically pertains to individual elements and their minimal generating polynomials over a base field.\\n\\n3. **Connection Analysis**: The definition of a splitting field focuses on the field containing all roots of the polynomial and the polynomial being able to be expressed entirely in linear factors within that field. The concept of minimal polynomials pertains to individual elements and their minimal generating polynomials over a base field, which is not directly required to establish whether a field is a splitting field. The splitting field definition does not inherently require knowing the minimal polynomials of the elements; it only requires that the polynomial splits into linear factors, indicating that each root is simple and directly generates a linear factor.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of minimal polynomials is not necessary for defining a splitting field of $X^q-X$ over its prime subfield. The essential requirement is the factorization of the polynomial into linear factors in the field, not the specific minimal polynomials of the elements.",
