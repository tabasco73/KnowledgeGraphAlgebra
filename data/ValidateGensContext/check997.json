                "Explanation": "The concept of a Reduced ideal is defined as an ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) in a ring \\\\(R\\\\) that satisfies the condition \\\\(\\mathfrak{a} = \\operatorname{rad} \\mathfrak{a}\\\\), where \\\\(\\operatorname{rad} \\mathfrak{a}\\\\) is the radical of the ideal, consisting of all elements \\\\(a \\\\in R\\\\) such that there exists some \\\\(n \\\\in \\mathbb{N}\\\\) with \\\\(a^{n} \\\\in \\mathfrak{a}\\\\). This definition focuses on the properties of the elements within the ideal and their powers, relating to the structure of the ring and the ideal itself.\\n\\nThe concept of a Finitely Generated Ideal, on the other hand, pertains to the way an ideal is constructed or generated, specifically stating that the ideal \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) can be generated by a finite number of elements from the ring \\\\(R\\\\).\\n\\nTo determine whether an ideal is reduced, one needs to examine the elements of the ideal and their powers, as specified by the radical condition. This examination does not inherently require the ideal to be finitely generated. The definition of a reduced ideal does not depend on how the ideal is generated (whether finitely or not), but rather on the algebraic properties of the elements within the ideal. Therefore, the concept of a Finitely Generated Ideal is not necessary for the definition of a Reduced ideal to make sense.",
