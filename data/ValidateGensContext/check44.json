                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Normalizer to make sense, we need to analyze the components of each definition:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Normalizer involves a group $G$ and a subset $S$ of $G$. The normalizer of $S$ in $G$ is defined as $N_{S} = \\{x \\in G ; xS = Sx\\}$. This definition inherently involves the operation of group multiplication (or the group operation), which is a specific type of law of composition. The condition $xS = Sx$ implies that for each element $x$ in the normalizer, the set obtained by multiplying $x$ with every element of $S$ (from the left) must be the same as the set obtained by multiplying every element of $S$ with $x$ (from the right).\\n\\n2. The concept of a Law of Composition is defined as a map from $M \\times M$ to $M$, which assigns a product to each pair of elements. This is exactly what is used in the definition of a group, where the group operation (e.g., multiplication or addition) is a law of composition.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Law of Composition is essential for the definition of a Normalizer, as the group operation (a specific type of law of composition) is fundamental to forming the condition $xS = Sx$ in the definition of a Normalizer.",
