                "Explanation": "The concept of a Domain is inherently linked to the definition of any function, including permutations. A permutation $\\\\$\\pi \\\\in \\\\\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\$ is a bijective function from the set \\\\$\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\\\$ to itself. This set \\\\$\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\\\$ is the domain of the permutation. The definition of the sign or signature of a permutation involves evaluating the permutation at different points within its domain (i.e., \\\\$\\pi(i)\\\\$ and \\\\$\\pi(j)\\\\$ for \\\\$i<j\\\\$). Therefore, understanding and defining the domain is crucial for making sense of how the permutation operates and subsequently for defining its sign or signature. Without a clear definition of the domain, it would be ambiguous as to what the inputs (i.e., \\\\$i\\\\$ and \\\\$j\\\\$) and the outputs (i.e., \\\\$\\pi(i)\\\\$ and \\\\$\\pi(j)\\\\$) of the permutation are, making the calculation of the sign undefined.",
