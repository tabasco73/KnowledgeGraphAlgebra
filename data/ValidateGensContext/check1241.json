                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Field is necessary for the definition of a Field Extension, we need to analyze the dependencies between the two concepts based on their definitions.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Field Extension explicitly mentions that it involves a pair of fields, $K$ and $L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$.\\n2. The term 'field' in the definition of Field Extension refers directly to the concept of a Field, which is defined as a commutative division ring.\\n3. Without the concept of a Field, the term 'field' in the definition of Field Extension would be undefined, making the definition incomplete and unclear.\\n4. Therefore, understanding what a Field is (a commutative division ring) is crucial to comprehending what it means for one field to be a subfield of another, which is central to the concept of a Field Extension.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Field must be defined and understood for the definition of a Field Extension to make sense. Without the foundational concept of a Field, the definition of a Field Extension would lack meaning and context.",
