The definition of a Trivial Algebraic field extension states that it is a field extension $L / K$ where every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$.\\n2. The definition of an Algebraic Element specifies that an element $\\beta \\n L$ is algebraic over $K$ if there exists a polynomial equation with coefficients in $K$ that $\\beta$ satisfies.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of an Algebraic Element is integral to understanding what it means for every element of $L$ to be algebraic over $K$. Without the definition of an Algebraic Element, we would not have a criterion to determine whether elements of $L$ satisfy the condition required for the extension to be considered trivial. Thus, the concept of an Algebraic Element is necessary to define what it means for an extension to be trivial algebraically.",
