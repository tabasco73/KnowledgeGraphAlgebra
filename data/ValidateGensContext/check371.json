                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Polynomial is necessary for the definition of a Finitely Generated Field Extension, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Finitely Generated Field Extension involves the existence of a field extension $K \\subset L$ and finitely many elements $\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n \\in L$ such that $L = K(\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n)$. This notation $K(\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n)$ implies that $L$ is the smallest field containing $K$ and the elements $\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_n$.\\n\\n2. The concept of generating a field extension by elements does not inherently require the concept of polynomials. It primarily involves the idea of including all elements that can be expressed using the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (except by zero), and combinations thereof, starting from the elements of $K$ and the $\\alpha_i$s.\\n\\n3. While polynomials might be used to describe certain elements in $L$ (for example, as minimal polynomials of algebraic elements over $K$), the definition of a finitely generated field extension itself does not depend on the concept of polynomials. The definition only requires the ability to perform field operations and to consider extensions generated by a finite set of elements.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of a Polynomial is not necessary for the definition of a Finitely Generated Field Extension to make sense. The definition of the field extension focuses on the field operations and the elements that generate the extension, rather than on polynomials per se.",
