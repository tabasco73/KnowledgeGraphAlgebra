            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

This definition focuses solely on the elements of the cycles and their membership in sets, without any reference to group operations or properties such as associativity, identity, or inverses.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Group involves a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies certain axioms like associativity, identity, and inverses. This definition is concerned with algebraic structures and operations within the set.\\n\\nGiven that the definition of Disjoint Cycles does not rely on or reference any properties or operations defined in the concept of a Group, it is clear that understanding or defining Disjoint Cycles does not require the concept of a Group. The definition of Disjoint Cycles is purely set-theoretical and does not involve algebraic operations that would necessitate the definition of a Group.",
