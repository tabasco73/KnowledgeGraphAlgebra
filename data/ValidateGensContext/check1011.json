                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Homomorphism involves a map between two rings, R and R', and specifies how this map behaves with respect to the ring operations (addition and multiplication). The definition requires that the map preserves the ring operations and the identity element, but it does not require that one ring be a subring of the other or that there be any containment relationship between the two rings.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Ring Extension specifically involves a containment relationship where one ring, S, is a subring of another ring, R. This concept is about the inclusion of one ring within another and does not inherently involve the mapping of elements between different rings as in the case of ring homomorphisms.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a Ring Homomorphism does not depend on the concept of a Ring Extension. A Ring Homomorphism can be defined and understood entirely without reference to whether one ring is a subring of another. The two concepts operate independently in the context of ring theory.",
