                "Explanation": "To understand the relationship between the concept of an 'Element of a Set' and the 'Galois group of a Field Extension', we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of the Galois group involves the concept of field automorphisms of $L$ that fix every element of $K$. This implies that $K$ and $L$ are sets (specifically, fields, which are special types of sets in mathematics).\\n\\n2. The automorphisms are mappings from the field $L$ to itself, and these mappings must preserve the structure of the field while fixing every element of the smaller field $K$. This means that the elements of the field $K$ are crucial to defining the automorphisms that constitute the Galois group.\\n\\n3. The concept of an 'Element of a Set' is fundamental in understanding what it means for an automorphism to 'fix' an element. Without understanding what an element of a set is, one cannot fully grasp what it means for such an element to be fixed by an automorphism.\\n\\n4. Therefore, the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary to define what it means for an automorphism to fix elements of $K$, which is a central part of the definition of the Galois group of a field extension.",
