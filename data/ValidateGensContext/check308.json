                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a commutative ring is necessary for the definition of a finitely generated ideal to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a finitely generated ideal states that an ideal in a ring is finitely generated if it admits a finite system of generators. This definition requires the concept of a ring and an ideal within that ring, but it does not specify that the ring must be commutative.\\n\\n2. The definition of a commutative ring specifies that the ring's multiplication operation must be commutative. This is a specific property of some rings, but not all.\\n\\n3. The concept of an ideal, including finitely generated ideals, exists in both commutative and non-commutative rings. Therefore, the property of being commutative is not a prerequisite for the existence or definition of ideals, including finitely generated ones.\\n\\n4. Thus, the definition of a finitely generated ideal does not inherently require that the ring be commutative. It only requires the ring to have a structure that supports ideals, which can be either commutative or non-commutative.",
