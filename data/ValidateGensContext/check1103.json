                "Explanation": "The definition of a K-homomorphism involves a field homomorphism between two field extensions L / K and L' / K. This definition inherently requires the concept of a field because it specifically refers to field extensions and field homomorphisms. A field extension L / K implies that L is a field that contains K as a subfield. Similarly, the concept of a field homomorphism involves a map between two fields that preserves the field operations. Therefore, the concept of a field is essential for defining what a field extension and a field homomorphism are, which are critical components of the definition of a K-homomorphism. Without the concept of a field, the terms 'field extension' and 'field homomorphism' would not have a meaningful or coherent definition, making the concept of a K-homomorphism nonsensical.",
