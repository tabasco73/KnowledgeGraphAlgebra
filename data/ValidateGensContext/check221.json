                "Explanation": "The concept of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial involves the field extension $L / K$ where a polynomial $f$ with coefficients in a field $K$ splits into linear factors in $L$. This definition inherently relies on the properties of fields, including the operations of addition and multiplication. Fields, by definition, are algebraic structures where addition and multiplication are both associative operations. Therefore, the associative law is already embedded in the definition of a field, and thus in the operations within the field $K$ and its extension $L$. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the Associative Law as a standalone concept pertains to the general property of operations in any set $M$, ensuring that the operation composition is associative. While this law is crucial in defining the structure of a field, it does not need to be separately defined or stated in the definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial. The associative nature of field operations is a given due to the definition of fields themselves. \\n\\nThus, while the associative property is essential to the operations within fields, it does not need to be independently defined for the concept of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial to make sense. The definition of a field, which includes the associative property, suffices.",
