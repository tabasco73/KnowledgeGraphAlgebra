                "Explanation": "The definition of a K-homomorphism inherently involves the concept of field extensions. A K-homomorphism is defined as a field homomorphism between two field extensions L/K and L'/K, where the homomorphism restricts to the identity map on K. This definition presupposes the existence of field extensions L/K and L'/K, meaning that L and L' are fields that extend K. Without the concept of a field extension, the notion of a K-homomorphism would lack the necessary context of L and L' being extensions of K, and thus the definition would not be meaningful or complete. Therefore, the concept of a field extension is necessary for the definition of a K-homomorphism to make sense.",
