                "Explanation": "The definition of a normal field extension explicitly states that it is an extension field that is the splitting field of a family of polynomials from the base field. This directly implies that the concept of a splitting field is integral to understanding and defining what a normal field extension is. The definition of a normal field extension includes the condition that the extension field \\(L\\) must be a splitting field for a family of polynomials in \\(K[X]\\), which is precisely what the concept of a splitting field describes. Therefore, without the concept of a splitting field, the definition of a normal field extension would lack the necessary framework to describe its essential properties and conditions.",
