                "Explanation": "A transposition, as defined, is a 2-cycle. A 2-cycle is a concept from permutation theory, which is a part of mathematics dealing with the arrangement of members of a set. Specifically, a 2-cycle refers to the swapping of two elements within a set. Therefore, the concept of a set is fundamental to understanding what a 2-cycle is, because without a set, there would be no elements to permute or swap. Thus, the definition of a transposition inherently relies on the concept of a set, as it involves the action of swapping two distinct elements within that set.",
