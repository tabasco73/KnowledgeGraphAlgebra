                "Explanation": "The concept of a splitting field of a family of polynomials involves extending a field \\(K\\) to another field \\(L\\) such that every polynomial in the family decomposes into linear factors in \\(L\\), and the extension is generated by the zeros of these polynomials. This concept inherently deals with fields, which are a special kind of ring with additional properties, specifically the existence of multiplicative inverses for every non-zero element.\\n\\nThe concept of a subring, on the other hand, involves a subset of a ring that itself forms a ring under the inherited operations. This concept is more general and does not necessarily involve fields or the properties specific to fields, such as the existence of multiplicative inverses.\\n\\nIn the definition of a splitting field, there is no requirement or necessity to consider subrings. The focus is entirely on fields and their extensions, which are themselves fields. The properties and operations considered in defining a splitting field (like field extensions and factorization of polynomials) do not require the concept of a subring. Therefore, understanding or defining a splitting field does not depend on the concept of a subring.",
