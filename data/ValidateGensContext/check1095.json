                "Explanation": "The concept of a submonoid is defined within the context of a monoid. A submonoid is a subset of a monoid that includes the identity element of the monoid and is closed under the monoid operation. This definition requires understanding the concepts of a monoid, identity element, and closure under an operation, but it does not inherently require any knowledge of groups, cyclic or otherwise.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a cyclic group is a specific type of group that can be generated by a single element. The definition of a cyclic group involves concepts specific to group theory, such as group homomorphisms and the structure of the group $\\\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\\\).\\n\\nSince the definition of a submonoid is independent of the concept of a group and focuses solely on the properties within a monoid, the concept of a cyclic group is not necessary to define or understand a submonoid. The two concepts operate within different frameworks (monoids for submonoids and groups for cyclic groups) and do not depend on each other for their definitions.",
