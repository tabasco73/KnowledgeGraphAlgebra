            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "The definition of the degree of a polynomial explicitly mentions the polynomial as being in the form f = sum a_i X^i in R[X], where R is a ring. This indicates that the polynomial is defined over a ring R. The coefficients a_i of the polynomial are elements of this ring R, and the operations of addition and multiplication (used in forming the polynomial expressions) are defined according to the ring's properties. Therefore, the concept of a ring is essential to define what the coefficients are and how they interact in the polynomial. Without the structure provided by a ring, the operations within the polynomial and the nature of the coefficients would not be well-defined, making it impossible to meaningfully discuss the degree of a polynomial. Thus, the concept of a ring is necessary for the definition of the degree of a polynomial to make sense.",
