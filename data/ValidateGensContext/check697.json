                "Explanation": "The concept of the Normalizer of a subset $S$ in a group $G$ involves the set of all elements $x$ in $G$ such that $xS = Sx$. This definition focuses on the relationship between elements of the group and the subset $S$, specifically looking at how elements of the group commute with the subset as a whole. The definition of the Normalizer does not explicitly require any knowledge about the total number of elements in the group, which is what the Order of a group describes.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Order of a group is a measure of the size of the group, either finite or infinite. This concept is useful for understanding the overall structure and properties of the group, such as whether it is finite or not, but it does not directly influence the definition or the existence of the Normalizer of a subset within the group.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a Normalizer can be fully established without any reference to the Order of the group. The Normalizer's definition is concerned with the algebraic relations within the group, independent of the group's size or Order.",
