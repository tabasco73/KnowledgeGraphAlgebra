                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields, we need to analyze the components of each definition:\\n\\n1. **Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields**: This group consists of automorphisms of the splitting field that fix the base field and permute the roots of the polynomial. The group structure implies the existence of operations such as composition of functions (automorphisms) and the identity function, which are inherent to the definition of a group.\\n\\n2. **Law of Composition**: This concept refers to a binary operation on a set, which maps pairs of elements from the set to another element within the same set. In the context of groups, the law of composition is essential as it defines how elements of the group (in this case, automorphisms) combine with each other to form another element of the group.\\n\\nGiven that the Galois group is indeed a group, it inherently requires a law of composition to define how the automorphisms combine. This law of composition is typically function composition in the case of groups of automorphisms. Therefore, the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of the Galois Group of a Polynomial Splitting Fields to make sense, as it provides the fundamental operation that defines the group structure.",
