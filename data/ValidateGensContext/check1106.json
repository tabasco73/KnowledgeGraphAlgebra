                "Explanation": "The concept of a submonoid involves a subset of a monoid that itself forms a monoid under the same operation as the original monoid. The definition of a submonoid requires that the subset contains the identity element and is closed under the monoid operation. This definition is self-contained and does not reference or require the concept of the order of a group or monoid.\\n\\nThe order of a group or monoid, on the other hand, pertains to the number of elements in the group or monoid. This concept is useful for understanding the structure and properties of the group or monoid, such as its finiteness or infiniteness, but it is not necessary for defining what a submonoid is. The existence and properties of a submonoid can be fully understood and analyzed without any reference to the order of the original monoid or any group.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of the order of a group or monoid is not needed to define or understand the concept of a submonoid. The two concepts operate independently in the context of abstract algebra.",
