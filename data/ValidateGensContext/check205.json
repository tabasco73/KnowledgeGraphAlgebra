                "Explanation": "The definition of the product of ideals involves the set of all finite sums of products of elements from two ideals, $\\text{ideal } \\\\(\\mathfrak{a}\\\\) and \\\\(\\mathfrak{b}\\\\)$, in a ring \\\\(R\\\\). This definition does not inherently require the associative law to be defined or used directly. The associative law pertains to the operation of multiplication within the ring \\\\(R\\\\) itself, ensuring that the order of multiplication does not affect the outcome. However, the definition of the product of ideals is concerned with the set of all possible products of elements from the two ideals, and does not depend on the associativity of the multiplication directly for its definition. The associative property is a characteristic of the ring's multiplication operation, which indirectly affects how elements within the ideals can be combined, but it is not a prerequisite for understanding or defining the product of two ideals. Thus, the associative law does not need to be defined for the concept of the product of ideals to make sense, as the product of ideals is primarily about forming a set from products of elements from each ideal, regardless of the associative nature of the multiplication in the ring.",
