                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is necessary for defining a 'Splitting Field of Polynomial', we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a 'Splitting Field of Polynomial' involves a polynomial $f$ with coefficients in a field $K$, and a field extension $L / K$ where the polynomial $f$ splits into linear factors.\\n2. The polynomial $f$ is defined to be in $K[X]$, which implies $f$ is an element of the set of polynomials over $K$. This already uses the concept of an element belonging to a set.\\n3. Furthermore, the field extension $L / K$ implies that $L$ and $K$ are sets (fields are special kinds of sets), and elements of $K$ are also elements of $L$. This again uses the concept of elements of a set.\\n4. The requirement that $f$ splits into linear factors in $L$ implies that each factor (which is a polynomial and thus an element of the polynomial set over $L$) must be considered individually as elements.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of an 'Element of a Set' is fundamental in understanding and defining what a 'Splitting Field of Polynomial' is. Without the concept of elements of a set, we cannot properly discuss the constituents of the fields $K$ and $L$, nor the polynomials in $K[X]$ or their factors in $L$.",
