                "Explanation": "The concept of the characteristic of a field is crucial when discussing separable polynomials, particularly in fields of positive characteristic. In fields of characteristic zero, every irreducible polynomial is separable. However, in fields of positive characteristic, a polynomial may fail to be separable if it is inseparable, which occurs when the polynomial has multiple roots or when its derivative is zero. This situation is directly influenced by the field's characteristic. For example, in a field of characteristic $p > 0$, a polynomial like $x^p - a$ might have repeated roots, depending on $a$. Thus, understanding whether a polynomial is separable in fields of positive characteristic requires knowledge of the field's characteristic. Therefore, the concept of the characteristic of a field is necessary for a complete understanding and definition of separable polynomials, especially to determine conditions under which a polynomial might have multiple roots.",
