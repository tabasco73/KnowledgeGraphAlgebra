                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Set is necessary for defining a Splitting Field, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a Splitting Field:\\n\\n1. **Field**: A field is a set equipped with two operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties (associativity, commutativity, distributivity, existence of identity and inverses for both operations except for the additive inverse of the zero element).\\n\\n2. **Polynomial $X^q-X$**: A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients, structured specifically as a finite sum of terms, each term including a variable raised to a non-negative integer power and multiplied by a coefficient. The coefficients and variables of a polynomial belong to a set, in this case, the set that forms the field over which the polynomial is defined.\\n\\n3. **Prime Subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$**: The prime subfield of a field is the smallest subfield containing the identity element of the field. It is formed by the set of multiples of the identity under addition.\\n\\n4. **Factorization into Linear Factors**: Factorization refers to expressing a polynomial as a product of its factors, which are also polynomials. The requirement that these factors be linear (polynomials of degree one) implies dealing with sets of polynomials.\\n\\n5. **Zeros of $X^q-X$**: The zeros of a polynomial are the elements of the field that satisfy the polynomial equation (i.e., make the polynomial equal to zero). These zeros form a set within the field.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of a set is fundamental in defining a field, a polynomial, the prime subfield, and the factorization process, all of which are essential in the definition of a Splitting Field. Without the concept of a set, none of these components could be properly defined or understood.",
