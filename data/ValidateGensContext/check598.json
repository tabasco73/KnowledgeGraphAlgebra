                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a commutative ring is necessary for the definition of an algebraic field extension, we need to analyze the dependencies of the concepts involved.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Algebraic Field Extension**: This concept involves an extension field $L$ over a field $K$, where every element in $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This definition inherently requires the understanding of fields, elements being algebraic, and field extensions.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Commutative Ring**: A commutative ring is defined as a ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. This definition is broader and includes more general structures than fields, as all fields are commutative rings, but not all commutative rings are fields.\\n\\n3. **Dependency Analysis**: The definition of an algebraic field extension specifically involves fields, which are a special kind of commutative ring. However, the concept of a commutative ring itself is not directly necessary for understanding an algebraic field extension. The essential concepts for an algebraic field extension are those of fields and the property of being algebraic, which are more specific than the general concept of a commutative ring.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: While fields, which are involved in the definition of algebraic field extensions, are indeed commutative rings, the broader concept of a commutative ring is not required to understand or define an algebraic field extension. The specific properties and structure of fields are sufficient and more directly relevant.",
