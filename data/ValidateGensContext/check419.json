                "Explanation": "The concept of a Right Coset involves a group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ of $G$. The right coset of $H$ in $G$ is defined as $Ha = \\{ha; h \\in H\\}$ for some $a \\in G$. This definition relies solely on the group operation within $G$ and does not require any external set $X$ or an action of $G$ on $X$. It is purely an internal operation within the group $G$ itself.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a Group Action involves a group $G$ acting on an external set $X$ through a specific map that satisfies certain properties. This concept is broader and involves interactions between the group and another set, which is not required for defining a right coset.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition and understanding of a right coset do not depend on the concept of a group action on some set $X$. The group action is a separate concept that deals with the interaction of group elements with elements of a different set, which is not necessary for defining or understanding right cosets within a group.",
