More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a group focuses on the properties of a set with a binary operation that is associative, has a unit element, and where every element has an inverse. This definition establishes the internal structure of a group and does not inherently require the concept of a monoid homomorphism. A monoid homomorphism is a function between two monoids that preserves the monoid structure, specifically the unit element and the operation. While understanding monoid homomorphisms can be useful for studying relationships between groups (or monoids), the definition and understanding of a group itself are independent of the concept of monoid homomorphisms. Therefore, the concept of a monoid homomorphism is not necessary for the definition of a group to make sense.",
