More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "The definition of a group focuses on the structural properties of the set and its elements, specifically the existence of an associative binary operation, a unit element, and inverses for each element. These properties are sufficient to define the concept of a group and do not depend on the number of elements in the group. The order of a group, which refers to the number of elements in the group, is an additional characteristic that can be considered after the group itself is defined. Therefore, knowing the order of a group is not necessary for the group's definition to make sense. The concept of a group is fully defined by its algebraic properties, and the order of a group is a separate concept that describes a quantitative aspect of the group, not a fundamental requirement for its definition.",
