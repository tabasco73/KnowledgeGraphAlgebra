                "Explanation": "The concept of the degree of a field extension is crucial for understanding the structure and properties of field extensions, which are fundamental in the definition of the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting field. The degree of the field extension $[L: K]$ tells us how 'large' the extension is in terms of the dimension of $L$ as a vector space over $K$. This is important because the Galois group consists of automorphisms of the splitting field $L$ that fix the base field $K$. Knowing the degree of the extension helps in understanding the complexity and the possible structure of these automorphisms. For instance, the size of the Galois group is often closely related to the degree of the field extension. Therefore, without the concept of the degree of a field extension, the definition and study of the Galois group of a polynomial's splitting fields would lack a necessary context for understanding how the automorphisms relate to the field structure.",
