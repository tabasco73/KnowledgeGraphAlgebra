                "Explanation": "Kronecker's construction involves the concept of ideals in a polynomial ring, specifically the ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial. This construction is used to create an extension field by taking the quotient of the polynomial ring by this ideal. The trivial ideals, which are the zero ideal and the unit ideal, are basic concepts in ring theory and are particularly relevant in the context of fields, where they are the only ideals. However, the specific process of Kronecker's construction does not inherently require the definition or use of trivial ideals. The focus of Kronecker's construction is on the ideal generated by an irreducible polynomial, which is not a trivial ideal. Therefore, while an understanding of ideals in general, including trivial ideals, is foundational for understanding any construction involving ideals, the definition of trivial ideals is not specifically required to make sense of Kronecker's construction.",
