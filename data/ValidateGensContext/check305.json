                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Map/Function is necessary for the definition of the Sign or Signature of a Permutation, we need to analyze the components involved in the definition of the Sign or Signature of a Permutation.\\n\\n1. The definition of the Sign or Signature of a Permutation involves a permutation \\\\(\\pi\\\\) which is a function from a set \\\\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\\\) to itself. This is because a permutation is a bijective function mapping each element of the set to another element in a one-to-one and onto manner.\\n\\n2. The definition uses the notation \\\\(\\pi(i)\\\\) and \\\\(\\pi(j)\\\\), which are the images of the elements \\\\(i\\\\) and \\\\(j\\\\) under the permutation \\\\(\\pi\\\\). This directly uses the concept of a function, as \\\\(\\pi\\\\) is applying a mapping from the domain (the set \\\\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\\\)) to the codomain (the same set).\\n\\n3. The product \\\\(\\prod_{i<j} \\frac{\\pi(i)-\\pi(j)}{i-j}\\\\) used in the definition calculates values based on the outputs of the function \\\\(\\pi\\\\), which are the results of applying the map \\\\(\\pi\\\\) to the inputs \\\\(i\\\\) and \\\\(j\\\\).\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a Map/Function is inherently used in the definition of the Sign or Signature of a Permutation. The permutation itself is a function, and understanding its behavior and properties (like being even or odd) relies on understanding it as a function. Therefore, the concept of a Map/Function must be defined and understood for the definition of the Sign or Signature of a Permutation to make sense.",
