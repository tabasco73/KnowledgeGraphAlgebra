                "Explanation": "To determine if a polynomial is irreducible, one must assess whether it can be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials. The concept of a non-constant polynomial inherently involves the degree of the polynomial. A non-constant polynomial is one whose degree is at least 1. Therefore, understanding and defining the degree of a polynomial is crucial to identifying whether a polynomial is non-constant. Without the concept of the degree of a polynomial, it would be challenging to define what constitutes a non-constant polynomial and, consequently, to apply the definition of an irreducible polynomial. Thus, the concept of the degree of a polynomial is necessary for the definition of an irreducible polynomial to be meaningful and applicable.",
