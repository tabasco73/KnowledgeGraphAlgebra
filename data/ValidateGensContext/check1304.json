                "Explanation": "The concept of a cyclic group involves a group being generated by a single element, which means there exists an element in the group such that every element of the group can be expressed as some power of this generator. This concept is fundamentally about the properties of elements within a single set and their powers.\\n\\nThe Cartesian product, on the other hand, involves creating a set of ordered pairs from elements of a set or between two sets. It is used to define binary operations or relations on sets, but it is not inherently necessary for defining what a cyclic group is. The definition of a cyclic group does not require the concept of ordered pairs or the product of sets, but rather focuses on the existence of a generating element and the structure of the group as related to this generator.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Cartesian product is not necessary for the definition of a cyclic group. The definition and understanding of cyclic groups can be fully achieved without reference to Cartesian products.",
