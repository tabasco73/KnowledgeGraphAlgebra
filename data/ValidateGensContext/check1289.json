                "Explanation": "The concept of a Factor Ring involves the construction of a quotient structure from a ring $R$ by an ideal $\\\\frak{a}$. In the definition of a Factor Ring, $\\\\frak{a}$ is treated as a normal subgroup of the additive group of $R$. This is crucial because the normality of $\\\\frak{a}$ ensures that the addition operation in the factor ring $R / \\\\frak{a}$ is well-defined and that the set of cosets forms a group under addition.\\n\\nThe concept of a Normal Subgroup is directly relevant here because it defines what it means for a subgroup to be normal: a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is normal if $aH = Ha$ for all $a \\\\text{ in } G$. This property is essential for the operation of coset multiplication in the group context, and similarly, the normality of $\\\\frak{a}$ in the additive group of $R$ is essential for the operations in the factor ring.\\n\\nTherefore, understanding and defining a normal subgroup is necessary for the definition and proper functioning of a factor ring, as the ideal $\\\\frak{a}$ must be a normal subgroup of the additive group of $R$ for the factor ring to be well-defined and to inherit the ring structure.",
