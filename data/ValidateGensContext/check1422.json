                "Explanation": "The definition of an Algebraic Element inherently relies on the concept of a Field Extension. According to the provided definition, an element \\\\(\\alpha \\\\in L\\\\) is algebraic over \\\\(K\\\\) if it satisfies a certain polynomial equation with coefficients in \\\\(K\\\\), where \\\\(K \\\\subset L\\\\) is a field extension. This implies that the very notion of an algebraic element presupposes the existence of a field extension, as the element \\\\(\\alpha\\\\) must belong to a larger field \\\\(L\\\\) while the coefficients of the polynomial equation are in the smaller field \\\\(K\\\\). Without the concept of a field extension, the definition of an algebraic element would lack the necessary framework of having two fields \\\\(K\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\) where \\\\(K\\\\) is a subfield of \\\\(L\\\\). Thus, the concept of a field extension is essential for the definition of an algebraic element to make sense.",
