                "Explanation": "The concept of a maximal ideal is defined purely in terms of the containment relationships between ideals within a ring. Specifically, a maximal ideal is defined as a proper ideal that is not contained in any larger proper ideal. This definition relies solely on the set-theoretic properties of ideals within the ring and does not require any understanding of ring homomorphisms or their properties, such as surjectivity.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a ring epimorphism is defined as a surjective ring homomorphism from one ring to another. This concept is related to the function between rings and the behavior of elements under this function, specifically focusing on the surjectivity aspect of the homomorphism.\\n\\nSince the definition of a maximal ideal does not involve any concepts related to functions between rings or the properties of these functions, the concept of a ring epimorphism is not necessary to understand or define a maximal ideal. The two concepts operate independently in the context of ring theory.",
