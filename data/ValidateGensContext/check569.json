                "Explanation": "The concept of a Trivial Algebraic field extension is defined as an algebraic field extension where every element of L is algebraic over K. This concept specifically deals with the nature of the elements of L in relation to K, focusing on whether they satisfy algebraic equations with coefficients in K.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Degree of a Field Extension is defined as the dimension of L as a vector space over K, denoted as [L: K]. This concept measures the size of the extension in terms of vector space dimensions, not the algebraic properties of the elements.\\n\\nTo define or understand the Degree of a Field Extension, it is not necessary to know whether the extension is trivial or not. The degree simply quantifies how many K-linearly independent elements are needed to express any element of L, irrespective of whether these elements are algebraic or transcendental over K.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Trivial Algebraic field extension is not needed to define or make sense of the Degree of a Field Extension. The degree focuses on vector space dimensions, while the triviality of an algebraic extension pertains to the nature of the elements in the extension.",
