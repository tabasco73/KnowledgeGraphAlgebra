                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a Field is necessary for defining a Finitely Generated Field Extension, we need to analyze the components of the latter's definition. The definition of a Finitely Generated Field Extension involves a field extension $K \\subset L$. This implies that both $K$ and $L$ are fields. Therefore, the concept of a field, which is defined as a commutative division ring, is fundamental to understanding what $K$ and $L$ are in the context of the extension. Without the concept of a field, the terms $K$ and $L$ in the definition of a Finitely Generated Field Extension would lack meaning, as their properties and operations (like addition, multiplication, and division) derive from their nature as fields. Thus, the concept of a field is essential for the definition of a Finitely Generated Field Extension to be meaningful and complete.",
