                "Explanation": "The definition of a Factor Ring explicitly requires the concept of an Ideal. According to the definition provided, a Factor Ring $R / \\mathfrak{a}$ is constructed using an ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ in a ring $R$. The elements of the Factor Ring are defined as residue classes of the form $x + \\mathfrak{a}$, where $x$ is an element of $R$. The operations in the Factor Ring, both addition and multiplication, are defined based on the structure of the ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$. Therefore, without the concept of an Ideal, the definition of a Factor Ring would not be complete or meaningful, as the ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ is central to the construction and operation of the Factor Ring.",
