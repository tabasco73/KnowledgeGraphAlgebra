            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a group needs to be defined for the definition of a group homomorphism to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a group homomorphism starts by referring to monoids and their properties, and then specifies additional conditions if the monoids are groups. This implies that the concept of a group homomorphism builds upon the properties of monoids but adds further conditions that are specific to groups.\\n\\n2. The definition of a group homomorphism explicitly states that if the monoids $G$ and $G^{\\prime}$ are groups, then the homomorphism $\\varphi$ is called a group homomorphism. This indicates that the definition of a group homomorphism is contingent upon the monoids being groups, which are defined by specific properties such as every element having an inverse.\\n\\n3. Without the definition of a group, the specific properties that distinguish a group homomorphism from a monoid homomorphism (like dealing with inverses) would not be meaningful. The concept of a group provides the necessary context and properties that are essential for defining what makes a group homomorphism distinct from other types of homomorphisms.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a group is necessary for the definition of a group homomorphism to be meaningful and complete. Without understanding what a group is, one cannot fully comprehend or define what a group homomorphism entails.",
