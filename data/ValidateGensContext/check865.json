                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a cyclic group to make sense, we need to analyze the components of the definition of a cyclic group:\\n\\n1. A group $G$ is defined within the context of set theory, as a group itself is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies certain axioms (closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses).\\n\\n2. The definition of a cyclic group states that $G$ is generated by a single element. The concept of 'generation' in group theory involves creating a set that contains all powers (positive, negative, and zero) of the generating element. This set of powers forms a subgroup of $G$.\\n\\n3. The definition also mentions a surjective group homomorphism from $\\\\$\\mathbb{Z}\\\\$ to $G$. The concept of a homomorphism in group theory involves mappings between sets that preserve the group structure.\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the definition of a cyclic group inherently relies on the concept of sets, as the group itself must be understood as a set with additional structure, and operations within the group (like generation and homomorphisms) involve manipulations of subsets and mappings between sets.\\n\\nTherefore, without the concept of a set, the definition of a cyclic group would not be coherent or complete, as the fundamental notion of a group as a set with structure is essential to understanding what it means for a group to be cyclic.",
