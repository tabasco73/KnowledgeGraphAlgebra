                "Explanation": "The concept of a trivial algebraic field extension is defined as an extension where every element of the larger field $L$ is algebraic over the smaller field $K$. This means that each element of $L$ satisfies some polynomial equation with coefficients in $K$. \\n\\nThe concept of an algebraic closure of a field $K$, denoted as $\\bar{K}$, is a field that is both algebraically closed (no nontrivial polynomial over $\\bar{K}$ has unsolvable roots in $\\bar{K}$) and algebraic over $K$ (every element in $\\bar{K}$ is a root of some nontrivial polynomial with coefficients in $K$).\\n\\nTo define an algebraic closure of a field, it is essential to understand that every element of the closure is algebraic over the original field $K$. This is inherently the definition of a trivial algebraic field extension, where the extension field is entirely composed of elements that are algebraic over the base field. Thus, the concept of a trivial algebraic field extension is implicitly required to define an algebraic closure, as the latter is a special case of the former where the extension field is also algebraically closed.",
