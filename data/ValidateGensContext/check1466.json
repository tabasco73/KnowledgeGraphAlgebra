                "Explanation": "The concept of a codomain is inherently tied to the concept of a function or map. According to the provided definitions, a codomain is defined as the set containing all potential output values of a function. This definition presupposes the existence of a function, as it refers to the outputs that a function could potentially produce. Without the concept of a function or map, which establishes a relationship between a domain and a codomain, the idea of a codomain lacks context and meaning. Therefore, the concept of a function or map is necessary to define and understand what a codomain is.",
