                "Explanation": "The definition of a Factorial ring or unique factorization domain (UFD) explicitly states that it is an integral domain $R$ with additional properties concerning the factorization of its elements. Specifically, the definition begins by identifying the structure as an integral domain, and then adds conditions related to the unique factorization of elements within that domain. This implies that the concept of an integral domain is foundational and necessary for the concept of a UFD to be fully defined and understood. Without the properties of an integral domain, such as the absence of nontrivial zero divisors and the commutativity of the ring, the additional factorization properties specified in the definition of a UFD would not have a meaningful or consistent framework in which to apply. Therefore, the concept of an integral domain is essential and must be defined prior to or as part of the definition of a factorial ring or UFD.",
