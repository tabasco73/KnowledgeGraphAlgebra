                "Explanation": "The definition of an Alternating Group involves the concept of even permutations within the symmetric group \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\), which are permutations with a sign of +1. This definition focuses on the properties of permutations and their composition within the symmetric group, specifically their parity (even or odd). It does not inherently require the concept of a group acting on a set. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a Group Action involves a group operating on a set, which is a broader concept that can apply to any group and any set, not specifically to permutations or their properties within a group like \\\\(\\mathfrak{S}_{n}\\\\). While group actions can be related to permutations (for example, a group acting on itself by permutations), the definition of an Alternating Group is self-contained with the concepts of permutations and does not rely on the notion of a group action on an external set. \\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Group Action is not necessary to define an Alternating Group, as the latter can be fully understood and defined using the properties of permutations and their composition alone.",
