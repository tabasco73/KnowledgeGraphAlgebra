                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a separable polynomial is necessary for defining the splitting field of the polynomial $X^q - X$ over its prime subfield, we need to analyze the properties of the polynomial $X^q - X$ and its roots.\\n\\n1. **Polynomial $X^q - X$:** This polynomial is defined over a prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$, where $p$ is a prime number and $q = p^k$ for some integer $k$. The polynomial $X^q - X$ can be rewritten as $X(X^{q-1} - 1)$.\\n\\n2. **Roots of $X^q - X$:** The roots of $X^q - X$ are all elements $x$ in the field such that $x^q = x$. This includes all elements of the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, where $q = p^k$. Since $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a field of characteristic $p$, and the polynomial $X^q - X$ is derived from the Frobenius endomorphism ($x \\mapsto x^p$), it turns out that every element of $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a root of $X^q - X$.\\n\\n3. **Separability of $X^q - X$:** The derivative of $X^q - X$ is $qX^{q-1} - 1$. Since $q = p^k$, the derivative simplifies to $-1$ (as $pX^{q-1} = 0$ in characteristic $p$). Therefore, the derivative is nonzero everywhere, which implies that $X^q - X$ has no repeated roots and is a separable polynomial.\\n\\n4. **Necessity of Separability Concept:** Since $X^q - X$ is inherently separable, the concept of a separable polynomial is not specifically needed to define its splitting field. The splitting field simply needs to be a field where $X^q - X$ splits into linear factors, which is guaranteed by the nature of the polynomial itself being separable.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of a separable polynomial, while relevant in general polynomial theory, is not necessary to define the splitting field of $X^q - X$ over its prime subfield, as the polynomial is inherently separable.",
