            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of a Field, we need to analyze the components of each definition:\\n\\n1. A Field is defined as a commutative division ring. This implies that a Field must have two operations (usually addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties:\\n   - The operation of addition must form an abelian group. This means there must be an associative, commutative operation with an identity element and inverses for each element.\\n   - The operation of multiplication (excluding the additive identity) must also form an abelian group.\\n\\n2. A Group is defined as a set with a law of composition that is associative, has an identity element, and every element has an inverse. If the group is commutative (abelian), then the operation is also commutative.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the structure of a Field inherently relies on the concept of a Group. Both the additive and multiplicative structures of a Field are specialized forms of groups (abelian groups). Therefore, understanding and defining a Field necessitates the concept of a Group, particularly an abelian group, to properly define and understand the operations within a Field.",
