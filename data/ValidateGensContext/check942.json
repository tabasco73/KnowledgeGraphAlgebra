                "Explanation": "The concept of a Finite Ring Homomorphism is built upon the foundational concept of a Ring Homomorphism. The definition of a Finite Ring Homomorphism specifically refers to a 'ring homomorphism' $\\varphi: A \\rightarrow B$ and then adds additional conditions regarding the finiteness of $B$ as an $A$-module under $\\varphi$. Without understanding what a ring homomorphism is, one cannot fully comprehend what it means for such a homomorphism to be finite. The definition of a Ring Homomorphism provides the necessary criteria for a function between two rings to preserve the ring operations (addition and multiplication), which is essential before any further properties (like finiteness) can be considered. Therefore, the concept of a Ring Homomorphism is indeed necessary for the definition of a Finite Ring Homomorphism to make sense.",
