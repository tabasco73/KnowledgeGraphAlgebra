                "Explanation": "The definition of a Monoid Homomorphism explicitly states that it is a map from one monoid to another. This map must satisfy certain properties specific to the structure of monoids, such as preserving the unit element and the operation of the monoid. Without the concept of a map or function, the notion of a monoid homomorphism would not make sense because it relies on the idea of associating elements of one monoid with elements of another in a specific manner. Therefore, the concept of a map or function is essential for defining what a monoid homomorphism is.",
