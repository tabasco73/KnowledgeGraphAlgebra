                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring Extension is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic closure of a field, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. Algebraic closure of a field: This is defined as an algebraically closed field that is algebraic over another field $K$. This means that every element of the algebraic closure $\\bar{K}$ is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in $K$. Importantly, $\\bar{K}$ contains $K$ and every polynomial in $K[x]$ splits completely in $\\bar{K}[x].\\n\\n2. Ring Extension: This concept involves a pair (S, R) where S is a subring of R. This definition focuses on the relationship between two rings, where one is a subset of the other and inherits its ring structure.\\n\\nIn the context of fields and their algebraic closures, while $\\bar{K}$ does indeed contain $K$ and can be considered an extension of $K$ in the sense of field theory, the specific concept of a Ring Extension as defined here is not strictly necessary to understand or define an algebraic closure. The definition of an algebraic closure inherently involves the concept of fields and polynomials, but it does not rely on the general concept of ring extensions. The essential aspects are the properties of being algebraically closed and every element being algebraic over the base field $K$, rather than the structure of ring extensions per se.",
