                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Field needs to be defined for the concept of a Field of Fractions to make sense, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Field of Fractions involves creating a set of equivalence classes from an integral domain $R$. This set, $Q(R)$, is constructed such that each element behaves like a fraction, where the operations of addition and multiplication are defined similarly to those in a field.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Field is a commutative division ring, which implies that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, and the operations of addition and multiplication are commutative.\\n\\n3. The purpose of constructing a Field of Fractions from an integral domain is to extend the integral domain into a larger structure where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, effectively making it a field. Thus, the concept of a Field of Fractions inherently aims to create a field from an integral domain.\\n\\n4. Understanding what a field is (a set where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse and operations are commutative) is crucial for grasping why and how the Field of Fractions is constructed and why it results in a field. Without knowing what a field is, the significance and the structural goal of the Field of Fractions would not be clear.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Field is necessary to fully understand and justify the construction and purpose of a Field of Fractions. The definition and properties of a field provide the foundational knowledge needed to appreciate why the Field of Fractions is structured the way it is and what it achieves by extending an integral domain.",
