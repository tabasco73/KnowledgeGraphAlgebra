A ring homomorphism is a function that preserves the ring operations (addition and multiplication) between two rings. Injectivity means that different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain.\\n\\n2. **Commutative Law**: This law states that a binary operation on a set is commutative if the order of the operands does not affect the result (i.e., $ab = ba$).\\n\\nThe definition of a ring monomorphism does not explicitly require the ring operations to be commutative. It only requires the operations to be preserved and the mapping to be injective. The concept of commutativity pertains to the specific nature of the operation within the ring, but it is not a prerequisite for defining or understanding what a ring homomorphism (and thus a monomorphism) is. Therefore, the definition of a ring monomorphism can be understood and applied regardless of whether the rings involved are commutative or not.",
