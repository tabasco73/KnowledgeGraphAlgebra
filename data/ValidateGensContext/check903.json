                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Field Extension is necessary for the definition of a Galois extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Galois extension states that an extension $K_{r} / K$ is Galois if it is both normal and separable. This definition inherently uses the term 'extension', which implies a relationship between two fields, specifically that one field is a superset of the other.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Field Extension explicitly describes this relationship, defining it as a pair of fields $K \\subset L$, where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This establishes the structural framework necessary to discuss any properties of the relationship between $K$ and $L$, such as them being normal or separable.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a Field Extension, the term 'extension' in the definition of a Galois extension would lack a formal basis, making it ambiguous and undefined within the context of field theory. Thus, the concept of a Field Extension provides the foundational understanding required to meaningfully discuss what it means for one field to be an extension of another in terms of properties like normality and separability.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Field Extension is essential for the definition of a Galois extension to be complete and meaningful.",
