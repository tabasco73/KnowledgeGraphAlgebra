                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of the inverse of an element, we need to analyze the definition of the inverse of an element in the context of a monoid. A monoid is a mathematical structure that includes a set and an associative binary operation, and it also contains an identity element. The definition of the inverse of an element specifically states that for a monoid $M$, an element $b \\in M$ is called an inverse of $a \\in M$ if $ab = e = ba$. Here, $M$ is implicitly a set because it is part of the definition of a monoid. Therefore, the concept of a set is inherently required because the elements $a$ and $b$ must belong to some set $M$ for the operations and the concept of an inverse to be meaningful. Without the concept of a set, the notion of 'elements belonging to $M$' and the operation between them would not make sense, as there would be no defined collection of objects (set) to which these elements and operations could apply.",
