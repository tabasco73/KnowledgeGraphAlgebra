                "Explanation": "To understand whether the concept of a submodule is necessary for defining a residue class module, we need to analyze the given definitions:\\n\\n1. The definition of a residue class module explicitly mentions that it is formed by a submodule N of an A-module M. It states that the residue class module M/N consists of the cosets of N in M.\\n\\n2. The concept of cosets and the operation of forming M/N inherently requires the existence of a submodule N. Without N being a submodule, the operations and the structure necessary to form cosets and hence the residue class module would not be well-defined.\\n\\n3. The definition of a submodule provides the necessary properties that N must satisfy to be considered a submodule (closed under the operations of M). This closure and structure are essential for the operations in M/N to be well-defined and for M/N to inherit module properties.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the concept of a submodule is essential and must be defined prior to or alongside the definition of a residue class module. Without the concept of a submodule, the definition of a residue class module would lack the necessary structure and clarity.",
