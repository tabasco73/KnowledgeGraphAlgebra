                "Explanation": "The concept of a Ring Epimorphism is defined as a ring homomorphism that is surjective, meaning it maps every element of the codomain to at least one element of the domain. This definition is self-contained and does not inherently require any other concepts beyond the understanding of what a ring, a homomorphism, and surjectivity are.\\n\\nThe concept of a Canonical Homomorphism, as defined, specifically refers to a type of ring homomorphism that reduces coefficients of a polynomial modulo a prime element in a ring. This is a specific example of a ring homomorphism and does not generalize to all ring homomorphisms or to the broader concept of epimorphisms.\\n\\nTherefore, the definition of a Ring Epimorphism does not depend on the concept of a Canonical Homomorphism. The definition of Ring Epimorphism is based on general properties of homomorphisms and surjectivity, and does not require the specific instance of reducing polynomial coefficients modulo a prime element, which is the essence of the Canonical Homomorphism.",
