                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Purely Inseparable Extension is necessary for the definition of an Algebraic Closure of a Finite Field, we need to analyze the relationship between these concepts.\\n\\n1. **Definition of Algebraic Closure of Finite Field**: This is a field that contains a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and all its algebraic extensions. It essentially includes all fields $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ for any $n$. The definition focuses on the inclusion of all algebraic extensions, but does not specify the nature of these extensions, whether they are separable or purely inseparable.\\n\\n2. **Definition of Purely Inseparable Extension**: This concept specifically deals with field extensions where the minimal polynomial of any element has a single, repeated root. This is a specific type of algebraic extension.\\n\\n3. **Relation to Algebraic Closure**: The algebraic closure of a finite field includes all possible algebraic extensions, both separable and purely inseparable. However, the definition of an algebraic closure does not inherently require that extensions be purely inseparable; it only requires that all algebraic extensions be included.\\n\\n4. **Conclusion**: The concept of a purely inseparable extension is a subset of the broader category of algebraic extensions. While it is true that purely inseparable extensions may be included in the algebraic closure, the definition of algebraic closure itself does not depend on the concept of purely inseparable extensions. It is sufficient to know that all algebraic extensions (whether separable or purely inseparable) are included.",
