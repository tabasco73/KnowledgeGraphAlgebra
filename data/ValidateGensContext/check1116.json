                "Explanation": "The definition of an algebraically closed field inherently involves the concept of a polynomial ring. Specifically, the definition states that a field $K$ is algebraically closed if every nonconstant polynomial $f$ of $K[X]$ admits a zero in $K$. Here, $K[X]$ represents the polynomial ring formed by the field $K$. This implies that the concept of a polynomial ring is essential for defining what it means for a field to be algebraically closed, as it provides the framework within which polynomials are considered and their properties (like having zeros in the field) are analyzed. Without the concept of a polynomial ring, the notion of checking whether every polynomial has a zero in the field, and thus the definition of an algebraically closed field, would not be properly formulated.",
