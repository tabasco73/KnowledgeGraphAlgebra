The definition of a Factor Group involves a 'normal subgroup $N \\subset G$ of a group $G$'. A subgroup and a group are both special cases of sets with additional structure (operations and axioms).\\n\\n2. The Factor Group $G / N$ is described as being formed by the 'set of left cosets of $N$ in $G$'. A coset is a subset of the group, and thus inherently a set.\\n\\n3. The operation within the Factor Group is defined on these cosets (which are sets).\\n\\nFrom these points, it is clear that the concept of a set is fundamental to the definition of both a group and a subgroup, and by extension, a factor group. The factor group itself is explicitly described as a set of cosets. Therefore, without the concept of a set, the definition of a factor group would not make sense as it relies on the notion of collections of elements (sets) and operations defined on them.",
