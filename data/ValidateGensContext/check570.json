                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of the Degree of a Field Extension is necessary for defining a Trivial Algebraic field extension, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. Trivial Algebraic field extension: This is defined as an extension where every element of $L$ is algebraic over $K$. This definition focuses on the nature of the elements of $L$ relative to $K$, specifically whether they satisfy a polynomial equation with coefficients in $K$.\\n\\n2. Degree of a Field Extension: This concept measures the dimension of $L$ as a vector space over $K$. It quantifies the 'size' or 'complexity' of the extension in terms of vector space dimensions.\\n\\nThe definition of a Trivial Algebraic field extension does not inherently require the concept of the degree of the extension. It solely depends on the algebraic nature of the elements of $L$ over $K$, not on the dimensionality of $L$ over $K$. Therefore, knowing whether the extension is finite or infinite (the degree) is not necessary to determine if the extension is trivial in the algebraic sense.",
