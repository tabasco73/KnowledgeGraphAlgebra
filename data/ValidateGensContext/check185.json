                "Explanation": "The concept of a normal subgroup involves the condition that the left and right cosets of a subgroup $H$ in a group $G$ are equal for all elements $a$ in $G$. This condition, $aH = Ha$, relies on the group operation and the properties of the group, including the group being closed under the operation, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverses for each element.\\n\\nThe associative law, defined as $(ab)c = a(bc)$ for all $a, b, c$ in a set $M$, is a fundamental property of group operations. This law ensures that the order in which the operations are performed does not affect the outcome, which is crucial for the structure and behavior of groups, including the handling of cosets and the definition of normal subgroups.\\n\\nWithout the associative property, the group operation would not necessarily be well-defined in the context needed for defining normal subgroups, where operations involving elements of the group and the subgroup must behave consistently regardless of grouping. Therefore, the associative law is essential for the definition and understanding of normal subgroups, as it underpins the group operation's consistency and predictability.",
