                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of an algebraic element, we need to analyze the components of the definition of an algebraic element. The definition states that given a field extension $K \\subset L$, an element $\\alpha \\in L$ is algebraic over $K$ if it satisfies a certain algebraic equation with coefficients in $K$. \\n\\n1. The notation $K \\subset L$ implies that $K$ and $L$ are sets, specifically sets of elements that form fields. \\n2. The expression $\\alpha \\in L$ uses the concept of set membership, indicating that $\\alpha$ is an element of the set $L$. \\n3. The coefficients $c_1, \\ldots, c_n \\in K$ also use set membership, indicating these coefficients are elements of the set $K$. \\n\\nThus, the definition of an algebraic element inherently relies on the concept of sets to describe the fields $K$ and $L$, and to express the membership of elements and coefficients within these fields. Without the concept of sets, the relationships and memberships described in the definition of an algebraic element would not have a clear or formal meaning.",
