            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a group needs to be defined for the definition of the order of a group to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies between the two concepts. The definition of the order of a group explicitly refers to the group $G$ and counts the number of elements in $G$. Without understanding what a group is, one cannot comprehend what the elements of $G$ are or why they are being counted. The definition of a group provides the necessary context by explaining that a group is a set with a specific structure and operations, which are crucial for understanding what constitutes the elements of the group. Therefore, the concept of a group must be defined and understood first to make sense of what the order of a group represents and why it is significant.",
