                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a set is necessary for the definition of a submodule to make sense, we need to analyze the structure and requirements of the definition of a submodule. A submodule, as defined, is a subset of an A-module M that is closed under the operations of M. This definition inherently relies on the concept of a subset, which is a smaller collection derived from a larger set. The concept of a subset cannot exist without the foundational concept of a set, as a subset is defined based on the properties of a set. Therefore, understanding and defining a submodule necessitates the prior understanding of what a set is, since the submodule is essentially a special type of set (subset) that adheres to additional structural rules within the context of module operations. Without the concept of a set, the notion of a subset, and consequently a submodule, would lack the necessary framework and definition.",
