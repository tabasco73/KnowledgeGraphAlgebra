            "A group is a monoid $G$ such that every element of $G$ admits an inverse. More explicitly, this means we are given a set $G$ with a law of composition $G \\times G \\longrightarrow G,(a, b) \\longmapsto a b$, such that: (i) The law is associative, i.e., we have $(a b) c=a(b c)$ for $a, b, c \\in G$. (ii) There exists $a$ unit element, i.e., an element $e \\in$ such that $e a=a=a e$ for all $a \\in G$. (iii) Every element $a \\in G$ admits an inverse, i.e., an element $b \\in G$ such that $a b=e=b a$. The group is called commutative or abelian if the law is commutative, i.e., if (iv) $a b=b a$ for all $a, b \\in G$."

                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Group is necessary for the definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial, we need to analyze the components and requirements of each definition.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial involves a field $K$ and a field extension $L/K$. It specifically focuses on the properties of fields where a polynomial $f$ splits into linear factors in $L$. This definition inherently involves understanding fields, polynomials, and field extensions.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Group involves a set with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element, and where every element has an inverse. The properties focus on the algebraic structure of the set and its elements under the operation.\\n\\n3. The concept of a field (used in the definition of a Splitting Field) includes some properties of groups, specifically the additive group of the field (which is an abelian group) and the multiplicative group of non-zero elements of the field (which is also an abelian group). However, the definition of a Splitting Field itself does not directly require the general concept of a Group but rather the specific properties of fields and field extensions.\\n\\n4. Therefore, while an understanding of groups can enhance the comprehension of fields (since fields are algebraic structures that include groups), the concept of a Group as defined is not directly necessary for defining a Splitting Field of a Polynomial. The essential concepts for understanding a Splitting Field are those of fields and field extensions, not the broader concept of groups.",
