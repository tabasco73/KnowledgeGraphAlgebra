                "Explanation": "The concept of the degree of a field extension is defined purely in terms of vector space dimensions over fields. Specifically, it involves the dimension of one field when considered as a vector space over another field. This definition is self-contained and relies only on the properties of fields and vector spaces.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the concept of a factorial ring or unique factorization domain (UFD) pertains to the factorization properties of elements within integral domains, specifically regarding the uniqueness of factorization into irreducibles or primes. This concept is relevant in the context of ring theory, particularly in studying the properties of elements within rings.\\n\\nThere is no direct or necessary connection between the structure of a field as a vector space over another field (which is the basis for defining the degree of a field extension) and the factorization properties of elements within a ring (as described in the definition of a UFD). The degree of a field extension can be fully understood and applied without any reference to whether the underlying ring structure of the field is a UFD.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a factorial ring or UFD is not needed to define or understand the degree of a field extension.",
