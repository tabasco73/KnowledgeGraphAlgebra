                "Explanation": "The definition of a K-homomorphism inherently involves the concept of field extensions, as it specifically refers to a field homomorphism between two field extensions L / K and L' / K. This implies that both L and L' are extension fields of K. Therefore, the concept of an extension field is crucial for defining what L / K and L' / K are, which are integral to the definition of a K-homomorphism. Without understanding what an extension field is, one cannot fully grasp the meaning of a K-homomorphism, as it relies on the properties and structure of extension fields. Thus, the concept of an extension field is necessary for the definition of a K-homomorphism to make sense.",
