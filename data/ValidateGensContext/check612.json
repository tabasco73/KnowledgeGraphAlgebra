            "A ring (admitting a unit element) is a set R together with two laws of composition written as addition '+' and multiplication '.' such that: (i) R is a commutative group with respect to addition. (ii) R is a monoid with respect to multiplication, i.e., the multiplication is associative, and there exists a unit element in R. (iii) The distributive laws hold, i.e., (a+b) \ncdot c=a \ncdot c+b \ncdot c, and c \ncdot(a+b)=c \ncdot a+c \ncdot b for all a, b, c in R."

                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Ring is necessary for the definition of a Factorial ring/unique factorization domain to make sense, we need to analyze the dependencies in the definitions provided.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Factorial ring/unique factorization domain begins by referring to an 'integral domain $R$'. An integral domain is a special type of ring that is commutative, has a multiplicative identity (1 \u2260 0), and has no zero divisors.\\n\\n2. Since an integral domain is a type of ring, the concept of a ring must be understood first to define what an integral domain is. Without understanding what a ring is, one cannot fully grasp the properties and structure of an integral domain.\\n\\n3. The definition of a ring provides the necessary groundwork by explaining the operations of addition and multiplication, and their properties such as associativity, the existence of a unit element, and the distributive laws. These are fundamental in understanding how elements in a ring (and thus in an integral domain) interact.\\n\\n4. Therefore, without the concept of a ring, the definition of an integral domain, and consequently the definition of a Factorial ring/unique factorization domain, would be incomplete and not understandable.",
