                "Explanation": "The definition of a maximal ideal does not explicitly require the ring $R$ to be commutative. A maximal ideal is defined as a proper ideal $\\\\mathfrak{m} \\\\subsetneq R$ in a ring $R$ such that for any ideal $\\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\subset R$ that contains $\\\\mathfrak{m}$, $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ must be either $\\\\mathfrak{m}$ or $R$. This definition applies to any ring, whether commutative or not.\\n\\nThe concept of the commutative law states that a law of composition on a set $M$ is commutative if $ab = ba$ for all elements $a, b \\\\in M$. This property is not required for the definition of a maximal ideal. Maximal ideals can exist in both commutative and non-commutative rings. Therefore, the commutative law is not a necessary condition for the concept of a maximal ideal to make sense.",
