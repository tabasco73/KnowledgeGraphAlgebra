                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field of Fractions is defined for any integral domain, which is a commutative ring with no zero divisors and a multiplicative identity. The definition of a Field of Fractions does not specifically require the integral domain to be a Dedekind domain; it only requires the domain to be an integral domain. A Dedekind domain is a specific type of integral domain with additional properties, such as unique factorization of ideals, but these properties are not necessary for the definition or existence of a Field of Fractions. Therefore, the concept of a Dedekind domain is not needed for the definition of a Field of Fractions to make sense.",
