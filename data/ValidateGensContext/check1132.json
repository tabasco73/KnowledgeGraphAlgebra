                "Explanation": "To determine whether the concept of a Field Extension is necessary for the definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial explicitly states that it is a field extension $L / K$ where the polynomial $f$ splits into linear factors. This implies that $L$ is an extension of $K$, meaning $K$ is a subfield of $L$.\\n\\n2. The definition of a Field Extension is that $K \\subset L$ where $K$ is a subfield of $L$. This relationship is fundamental to understanding what it means for $L$ to be an extension of $K$.\\n\\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that the concept of a Field Extension is integral to the definition of a Splitting Field of a Polynomial. Without understanding that $L$ is an extension of $K$ (i.e., without the concept of a Field Extension), the definition of a Splitting Field would lack the necessary context to explain the relationship between $K$ and $L$ and how $f$ splits within $L$.",
