                "Explanation": "The concept of an Algebraic Field Extension involves the idea that every element in the extension field $L$ is algebraic over the base field $K$. This means that for each element $\\beta$ in $L$, there exists a polynomial with coefficients in $K$ such that $\\beta$ is a root of this polynomial. This definition inherently relies on the properties of fields, including the operations of addition and multiplication.\\n\\nThe Associative Law, as defined, pertains to the property of a binary operation being associative, meaning that the grouping of operations does not affect the outcome. In the context of fields, both addition and multiplication are required to be associative operations. This is a fundamental property of fields and is necessary for the basic algebraic structure and operations within any field.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of an Associative Law is implicitly required for the definition of an Algebraic Field Extension to make sense, as the operations within the field (which the extension is built upon) must adhere to associative properties to maintain the field's structure and to perform algebraic operations correctly.",
