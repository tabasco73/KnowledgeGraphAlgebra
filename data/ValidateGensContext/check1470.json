                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Set is necessary for the definition of the Image of a Map, we need to analyze the definitions provided:\\n\\n1. The definition of the Image of a Map states that it is the 'set of all elements in B that have at least one corresponding element in A via the function f.' This definition explicitly uses the term 'set' to describe the collection of elements in B that are mapped from A.\\n\\n2. The concept of a Set is defined as a 'collection of distinct objects considered as an entity.' This definition provides the framework for understanding what a set is, which is crucial for interpreting the definition of the Image of a Map.\\n\\n3. Without the concept of a Set, the term 'set' in the definition of the Image of a Map would lack a clear meaning. The concept of a Set provides the necessary context to understand that the image of a function is a specific type of collection with distinct properties (i.e., distinct elements considered collectively).\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Set is essential for making sense of what an Image of a Map is, as it underpins the understanding of the collection described in the definition of the Image of a Map.",
