                "Explanation": "The concept of a Field of Fractions is defined specifically for an integral domain $R$. An integral domain is a type of ring with no zero divisors and a nonzero unity (1 \u2260 0). The definition of a Field of Fractions involves pairs $(a, b)$ where $b$ is not zero, which is meaningful because in an integral domain, division by any nonzero element is valid.\\n\\nThe Zero Ring, by definition, is a ring where the additive and multiplicative identities are the same (1 = 0), which means it contains only one element, zero, and does not allow for any meaningful division by nonzero elements because there are none. This ring does not qualify as an integral domain since it violates the condition 1 \u2260 0.\\n\\nTherefore, the concept of a Zero Ring is not only unnecessary for defining a Field of Fractions, but its properties actively contradict the requirements for an integral domain, the type of ring for which a Field of Fractions is defined. Thus, the Zero Ring does not need to be defined or considered when discussing or defining a Field of Fractions.",
