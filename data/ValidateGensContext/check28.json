                "Explanation": "To determine if the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Finitely Generated Ideal, we need to analyze the dependencies of the latter on the former.\\n\\n1. The definition of a Finitely Generated Ideal involves an ideal in a ring. A ring, by definition, is a set equipped with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties. These operations are examples of laws of composition, as they map pairs of elements from the ring to another element in the ring.\\n\\n2. The operations in a ring (addition and multiplication) are essential for defining what an ideal is. An ideal in a ring is a subset that is closed under these operations and interacts with the ring elements in specific ways defined by these operations.\\n\\n3. Therefore, the concept of a ring inherently includes the concept of laws of composition (the addition and multiplication operations). Without these operations, the structure of a ring would not exist, and consequently, the concept of an ideal, and thus a finitely generated ideal, would not make sense.\\n\\n4. Hence, the concept of a Law of Composition is necessary for the definition of a Finitely Generated Ideal because it underpins the structure of a ring, within which the ideal is defined.",
